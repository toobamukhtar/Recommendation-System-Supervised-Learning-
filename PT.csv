5,Elections 2018,https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/07/22/elections-2018-3/,"And Orwellian Doublespeak

Despite hiccups aplenty, Elections 2018 are finally being held. Pakistan in its checkered political history since 1970 has held ten national elections. But 2018 is unique in many respects.

Serious doubts have been expressed about the fairness of these elections. Except for the PTI (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf) questions have been raised at the ability of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and the caretaker governments at the federal level and in the provinces to provide a level playing field to all the parties.

Mechanically speaking on polling day voters are expected to have the freedom to exercise their franchise freely. But voters have already been presented with a fait accompli of sorts. The real rub is in fairness of the whole process that started many months ago to break the back of the PML-N, especially in its stronghold Punjab.

Not only the erstwhile ruling party, the PPP and some other political parties have complained of the not so hidden hand exerting maximum pressure on ‘electable’ candidates of these parties to switch their loyalties to the PTI. The sleuths have played their cards by cajoling, browbeating or even threatening candidates to switch their loyalties, albeit with mixed results.

The PML-N by default or by design (perhaps both) has been at the receiving end of the stick. It’s main vote catcher three times prime minister Nawaz Sharif is now incarcerated serving a 10 year jail sentence along with his daughter and heir apparent for seven years, both convicted on charges of corruption.

Not that he is squeaky clean, but the unholy haste shown to put Sharif away just before the elections date smacks of political vendetta according to critics. The ubiquitous establishment answering charges of meddling in the process blandly claims that it has nothing to do with (managing the) elections. But those in the PML-N-and the PPP to a lesser extent claim that they have been consistently arm-twisted by middle to lower level sleuths.

Plans were slightly upset when contrary to expectations that Sharif on the pretext of tending to his ailing wife in London will not return to serve his jail sentence. But he surprised many by heading to Lahore along with his daughter.

The caretakers and the security agencies were constrained to put the city under siege. Mobile telephone services were suspended and the Rangers blocked major arteries by placing scores of containers on that fateful Friday.

The main purpose to block Sharif’s possible interaction with his supporters was achieved when as soon as he arrived he was successfully whisked away to Adiala Jail near Rawalpindi. But the whole operation further damaged the credibility of the upcoming elections.

Another collateral damage has been the credibility and impartiality (or rather lack of it) of the caretaker provincial government in Punjab. Headed by a respected former academic the chief minster and his cabinet never rose above their personal biases against the PML-N and in favour of the PTI.

Not that he is squeaky clean, but the unholy haste shown to put Sharif away just before the elections date smacks of political vendetta according to critics

Some of the cabinet members of the Punjab caretaker setup are in fact cardholder members of the PTI. In the meanwhile scores of PML-N workers are being held either without any charges or on spurious grounds. Those who had assumed the days of preventive detentions harking back to military rules are in a state of shock.

No stone is being left unturned to ensure victory of the King’s party at the hustings. But yet there are apprehensions in some quarters that the PML-N despite the odds heavily stacked against it might just bag enough seats to remain a major player.

Perhaps the PML-N president Shahbaz Sharif is reading too much into the lackluster crowds at the Khan’s recent election meetings. But the PTI chief is rightly hopeful that he will be able to sweep the elections and form a government on his own strength in the parliament. This is quite possible but not without some favourable tailwind from the powers that be.

The conventional wisdom is a hung parliament. But many a time the war gamers have been proved wrong in the past. In the 1970 elections it was not being anticipated that Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto with his newly formed rag tag PPP would sweep in West Pakistan and Sheikh Mujeeb Ur Rehman in East Pakistan.

More recently general Musharraf in the 2002 elections carved out PML-Q from the leaderless PML-N and the Patriots from the PPP. Despite the intensely overt engineering the King’s party could barely scrape through to form a government.

In the present scenario despite concerted efforts to break the back of the PML-N it is largely intact. In Baluchistan the overnight emergence of BAP (Baluchistan Awami Party) earlier in the year was a new phenomenon without which the PML-N could not have been deprived of a majority in the Senate, thus enabling it to amend the constitution to its own advantages.

Similarly the now defunct Janoobi Punjab Sooba Mahaz (South Punjab Province Front) comprised of turncoats will go the way the wind blows, just like a weathercock.

Another interesting development to watch is how some of the jehadists and sectarian outfits fare in the elections. Of course some of these proscribed organizations were overnight dry cleaned to participate in the elections. Perhaps their assigned role is to play the ubiquitous spoiler.

In the past such infantile strategies have boomeranged. The Taliban and the MQM were created as a result of this very mindset.

PML–N senators including Pervez Rashid and Mushahid Hussain Syed have demanded that the election commission of Pakistan (ECP) and the caretaker government address their concerns about fairness of the election process urgently. Perhaps it is too late in the day for the PML-N senators to complain, as the die has already been cast.

Those who had assumed the days of preventive detentions harking back to military rules are in a state of shock

In the Islamic Republic, this is an age of Orwellian doublespeak. Everything including the elections is ostensibly being conducted to strengthen democracy. But the real – albeit unstated – purpose is to achieve just the opposite.

George Orwell in his eerily futuristic novel Nineteen Eighty-Four about the powers of a totalitarian state never used the word “double speak”. Nonetheless doublespeak came to be known as: a language that deliberately obscures disguises or reverses the meaning of words.

Surely elections 2018 just might prove to be the ultimate Orwellian elections."

Pakistani users receive a pop up in their news feed when they log onto the social media platform which reads, “Are you registered to vote? Text your CNIC to 8300 to make sure that you’re registered to vote in the election. SMS fees may apply.”

Clicking on the pop up redirects you to the ECP’s website where additional information about the electoral process is available for the knowledge of the voters.

7,PPP can win one NA seat from Attock district in elections 2018,https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/07/18/ppp-can-win-one-na-seat-from-attock-district-in-elections-2018/,"–Number of National Assembly seats in Attock reduced to 2 following preliminary delimitation

ISLAMABAD: A mixed result from Attock district is likely in the upcoming general election as a healthy competition is expected among the candidates contesting for the seats of the national assembly (NA) and provincial assembly (PA).

According to a preliminary revised delimitation list by ECP, Attock’s member of national assembly (MNA) seats have decreased from three to two, while the constituencies for Punjab Assembly have also witnessed a decrease from 8 to 7 seats. The total registered voters are 1,146,665 including 615,708 male and 530,957 female voters.

NA-55 Attock-II

In NA-55 of Attock district, the actual race is among three candidates out of many. The candidate of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) is a famous politician Major (r) Tahir Saddiq, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz’s (PML-N) candidate is Sheikh Aftab, and Zulfiqar Hayat is of Pakistan People’s Party (PPP).

At present, election campaigns of all three candidates are in full swings in the area. Although seasoned politician Sheikh Aftab of PML-N is considered to be a strong candidate to win NA-55, however, Major Sadiq has been giving the PML-N candidate a tough time with his strong election campaign. It is likely that Major Sadiq may win the constituency with a handsome margin as important families, groups, and panels have joined the ‘Major Group’.

NA-56 Attock-II

A strong fight is expected among five candidates who are Major Sadiq of PTI, Malik Sohail of PML-N, Pir Faisal Shahzad of Tehreek Labaik Ya Rasool Allah (TLY), Sardar Saleem Haider of PPP and independent candidate Malik Shaharyar Khan.

Each candidate is running his campaign with zeal, zest and the confidence that he will win with a majority of voters. However, a surprising result in favour of PPP candidate Sardar Saleem Haider is largely anticipated, especially after the PPP co-chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s recent visit in the area in addition to, door to door campaigning.

Major Sadiq is popular among the public and is a strong candidate but he is participating from two constituencies and one provincial assembly seat that are NA-55 and NA-56. It is said that he will win one NA seat and one provincial assembly seat from the district.

Another strong candidate is Malik Sohail from PML-N. Malik had earlier joined PTI but left the party due to some differences with Major Sadiq.

Malik Shahryar Khan is an independent candidate launched by famous ‘Khonda Group’ of the district after he was refused a ticket by PML-N. The Khonda family is the owner of 84 villages of the district, while ‘Khonda Group’ has a handsome vote bank in the entire district. Malik Shaharyar Khan is the son of former MNA and head of ‘Khonda Group’ Malik Allah Yar Khan.

PP-I Attock

Six candidates are contesting from PP-I and a tough competition is expected here. A tough competition is likely particularly between PTI’s Yawar Bokhari and an independent candidate Malik Hameed Akbar. Other candidates include Sheikh Salman Sarwar of PML-N and Malik Iqbal of MMA who are also in the run but the neck to neck competition will be between Bokhari and Malik Hameed.

PP-II Attock

Despite the participation of several candidates, a tough competition is likely among four candidates who are Qazi Ahmed Akbar of PTI, Jahangir Khanzada of PML-N, Ahmed Taj Khanzada of PPP and Changez Khan of MMA.

It is relevant to mention that so far, Khan and Taj Khanzada have gained a strong position during the election campaign. Changez Khan is said to be the right-hand man of Major Sadiq and it is estimated that he will give a tough time in the polls.

Also, Taj Khanzda being the son of the Khanzada family chief Taj Khanzada and contesting for the very first time on a PPP party ticket is in a strong position.

PP-III Attock

There is strong competition among three candidates of PP-III. These candidates include Major Sadiq, Haji Riaz Balrah of PPP and Advocate Asif Ali Malik who is a relative of Chaudry Nisar Ali Khan. So far, Major Sadiq has gained a strong position in the area and it is likely that he will win the provincial assembly seat from here.

Moreover, this is Major Sadiq’s native constituency.

PP-IV Attock

A healthy competition among four candidates is expected in PP-4 of Attock district. PPP has given party ticket to an old party worker Haji Akhtar to contest the election, while Chaudry Sher Ali, farmer provincial minister is ticket holder of PML-N, and Col. retd. Anwar is from PTI and Amanat Rawal has party ticket of TLY to give tough time to other competitors in the polls. At present, the position of TLY candidate, who is said very close to Major retd Tahir Saddiq, is strong. However, if Chaudry Sher Ali of PML-N succeeds in convincing angry groups and families who were with him in elections 2013 and senior leadership of PML-N pay visit in the area then he can win the seat but with a close margin.

PP-V Attock

Though there is a competition to win PP-5 seat among the candidates, actual competition on 5th July 2018 is expected among an independent candidate, PML-N candidate and PTI’s candidate. PML-N has awarded ticket to Sardar Bahadur and Jamshaid Altaf has PTI’s ticket while Pir Abbas Mohiuddin is participating in the election as independent candidate. All the candidates are currently engaged to acquire consent/approval of major groups and biradaries. So far, an independent candidate has gained major success in getting the approval of main groups/panels and biradaries of this constituency.

Independent candidate Pir Abbas Mohiuddin is giving a tough time to his rivals and there are greater chances of his success in next elections. Pir Abbas Mohiuddin is the son of farmer parliamentarian Pir Safiuddin who is a close relative of former prime minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani and the top man/’Gaddi Nasheen’ of the shrine of Makhad Sharif.

PPP candidate for NA-56 Sardar Saleem Haider is fully supporting the independent candidate and in return getting the vote bank of Pir Abbas Mohiuddin.

It is important to note here that wrong party ticket distribution by PTI might result in losing the PP-5 seat as party ticket holder Jamshaid Altaf belongs to Hassan Abdal and has no deep roots, linkages or vote bank in the area."

THATTA: Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari Monday said that after coming into power, his party would provide food cards to the masses.

Bilawal was speaking to his supporters in Gharo city of Thatta district while campaigning for the forthcoming elections. He said that they had presented their manifesto, noting that the party initiated revolutionary programmes like Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).

“PPP has always served the people and now I will resolve public issues by myself,” he said and added, “We will provide food cards to masses through which they will get subsidised food.”

Bilawal told the participants that he needed their support and urged them to become his arms. “I want to change the fate of the country, and if the people are with us, then no one can stop us,” he said.

The PPP chief said that eliminating hunger was a part of his party’s manifesto. “We will open food centres in every area, which will be run by women.”

Undeterred by a mob attack on his caravan a day earlier during his electoral rally in Karachi’s Lyari neighbourhood, Bilawal hit the city’s roads once again early Monday.

“PPP does not believe in the politics of violence,” the PPP chairman said, as he stepped out of his car en route to interior Sindh to address supporters.

“My warm welcome in Lyari did not go down well with opposing parties,” he added.

Speaking to supporters in Quaidabad, he said that stones were pelted at his rally on Sunday under a conspiracy.

The PPP chairman is due to visit Sujawal, Badin, Tando Mohammad Khan and Hyderabad districts on Monday.

After Sindh, Bilawal will campaign in southern Punjab and then on to the rest of the country. A detailed travel log of the PPP chief is yet to be issued by the party."
9,Elections 2018: Parties resort to monotonous campaigning in Rawalpindi,https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/06/29/elections-2018-parties-resort-to-monotonous-campaigning-in-rawalpindi/,"RAWALPINDI: With the elections, just a few weeks away, the campaigning for various parties has been limited to posters and banners due to the high temperature in the city and the lack of interest from the locals in Rawalpindi, a local media house reported.

This had been visible throughout the city as the election momentum has not yet been picked up by the party workers, thus resorting to the monotonous campaigning concept.

According to the local media report, during the previous elections in 2013, parties like Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) established its central elections office on Liaquat Road, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Murree Road and the Pakistan Muslim League -Nawaz (PML-N) on both.

However, as of now, the parties are more interested in settling disputes over the distribution of party tickets than actively campaigning for their candidates.

Other than Awami Muslim League’s Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, who has opened Lal Haveli to the public, political parties in the city have not made decisions on their elections schedule or central offices yet.

A senior PPP leader stated that the candidates are not willing to spend money. thus the party’s popularity in the city is not visible. Moreover, no plans for any public meetings had been decided.

Former PML-N MNA Malik Shakil Awan said electioneering was limited to door-to-door and street campaigning, and an election office would be established by the National Assembly candidate soon.

Former PTI MPA Arif Abbasi also admitted to a lack of momentum in the party’s campaigning because of a lack of interest on the part of candidates and workers.

During the 2013 elections, campaigning began two months earlier, with the inauguration of the PTI’s central office by Chairman Imran Khan. This time, however, the party was not interested in the work needed to establish a central office that will coordinate with all seven National Assembly constituencies in the district."

Moreover, the tribunal termed the returning officer’s decision as null and void. At the same time, it allowed former state minister Saira Afzal Tarar to contest the upcoming general election.

A voter from NA-87 (Hafizabad) had filed an appeal against the decision of the returning officer saying Tarar concealed details of her properties in nomination papers. However, the tribunal dismissed the appeal and upheld the decision of the returning officer.

PML-N’s covering candidate from NA-81 (Gujranwala), Atif Farid Sabir challenged the nomination papers of Maulana Jalali accusing him of not disclosing information about his income tax return.

He said Jalali had also failed to submit his passport to the returning officer despite an order issued by the Supreme Court. He said the returning officer had ignored the facts and accepted nomination papers of Jalali.

13,General Elections 2018: A war on social media,https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/06/23/general-elections-2018-a-war-on-social-media/,"ISLAMABAD: The emergence of social media has changed the course of election campaign altogether and has become the ubiquitous source of communication for candidates during election campaigns.

In the past, if the candidates wanted to reach voters during election campaigns, they used to hand out leaflets, knock on doors, hold corner meetings and drive around in vans speaking through loudspeakers.

Platforms like Facebook and Twitter enable candidates to directly reach out to voters, mobilize supporters, and influence the public agenda. These fundamental changes in political communication, therefore, present election candidates with a wide range of strategic choices.

The political parties earlier invested heavily in electronic and print media during election campaigns to get due coverage of their political activities, however, they can now convey their messages to the public to a greater extent, within no time, through social media with little investment.

So keeping in view the importance of social media, sources told Pakistan Today that various mainstream political parties have hired services of social media professionals and volunteers in order to reach out to the maximum number of people for the forthcoming general elections.

Though the political parties have yet to start formal electioneering because they have not finalised the process of distribution of tickets, their respective social media teams have already started vigorous campaigning on Facebook and Twitter.

All major political leaders especially Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan, Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Maryam Nawaz are the regular users of Twitter and have a great following.

However, PTI Chairman Imran Khan is the most popular leader on micro-blogging website Twitter in Pakistan with his followers reaching 8.03 million. Hence his tweets’ likes reach thousands within a few minutes. Maryam Nawaz comes second with more than 4.73 million while Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has 2.72 million followers on Twitter.

Similarly, the three political parties have official party accounts on Twitter as well on which PTI took the lead as its followers are 3.53 million while PML-N and PPP have mere 94,400 and 54,800 followers respectively.

Moreover, on Facebook too, the PTI has managed to maintain its supremacy as PTI chairman’s page is the most popular with 8.2 million followers while official PTI account has 5.8 million followers. On the other hand, Maryam Nawaz Sharif’s official page has 267,147 followers while PML-N’s Facebook page has 2.6 million followers.

Similarly, PPP’s official page on Facebook has over 195,663 followers while Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s Facebook followers are 156,655.

PTI is running an election campaign on social media with hashtag #WazireAzamImranKhan and #PTIrulesKP, while PML-N and PPP have highlighted development works done during the last five years to garner support for the upcoming polls.

PTI is also highlighting PTI government’s previous performance in KP in a unique way as trucks have been prepared with video screens and sound systems to present the performance of KP government to the people of the province during the election campaign.

These parties, however, refused to disclose their strategy when Pakistan Today contacted them."
14,Elections 2018,https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/06/21/elections-2018-2/,"Once again, the ROs

During 2013 elections the Returning Officers asked all sorts of irrelevant and funny questions to gauge the depth of the candidates’ religious knowledge, using Article 62 as an excuse, till barred by the Lahore High Court from seeking unnecessary information . This time again the ROs seem to have been provided no uniform standard to examine the nomination papers. This has led to the rejection of the papers of some of the leading contestants that include former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and PTI chief Imran Khan from NA-53 Islamabad. It was maintained that Abbasi had not submitted complete tax returns with his documents. It is difficult to believe that a man who has been elected six times to the National Assembly would submit incomplete documents. Imran Khan’s papers were rejected for failing to fill a column in the affidavit in which he was required to describe his performance as an MNA. This is surprising as papers of several legislators who never spoke a single word in the NA sittings have been accepted. Interestingly Khan’s nomination papers were validated by the ROs for NA-35 Bannu, NA-243 Karachi and NA-131 Lahore. There was a need for the ROs to be following a uniform policy in all constituencies. One hopes the Appellate Tribunals would undo the injustice.

A perception is fast growing that a particular party is being treated as more equal than others. The way a telephone call from Imran Khan led the interior secretary to remove the name of Zulfi Bukhari from the black list temporarily without even consulting NADRA has sent a message to the accountability body and bureaucracy that the PTI is to be treated as a favourite. The promise to reshuffle bureaucracy also follows a demand made by the PTI. The first woman to hold Punjab AGP office was removed from post because she was not acceptable to PTI. This has led LHBA to condemn the arbitrary removal calling it an “abuse of discretion and a blatant violation of due process”. Despite all these factors favourable to it the PTI remains perturbed over the outcome of the elections. The party is presumably upset over its failure to generate a popularity wave among the electorate."

22,Elections 2018,https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/07/22/elections-2018-3/,"And Orwellian Doublespeak

Despite hiccups aplenty, Elections 2018 are finally being held. Pakistan in its checkered political history since 1970 has held ten national elections. But 2018 is unique in many respects.

Serious doubts have been expressed about the fairness of these elections. Except for the PTI (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf) questions have been raised at the ability of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and the caretaker governments at the federal level and in the provinces to provide a level playing field to all the parties.

Mechanically speaking on polling day voters are expected to have the freedom to exercise their franchise freely. But voters have already been presented with a fait accompli of sorts. The real rub is in fairness of the whole process that started many months ago to break the back of the PML-N, especially in its stronghold Punjab.

Not only the erstwhile ruling party, the PPP and some other political parties have complained of the not so hidden hand exerting maximum pressure on ‘electable’ candidates of these parties to switch their loyalties to the PTI. The sleuths have played their cards by cajoling, browbeating or even threatening candidates to switch their loyalties, albeit with mixed results.

The PML-N by default or by design (perhaps both) has been at the receiving end of the stick. It’s main vote catcher three times prime minister Nawaz Sharif is now incarcerated serving a 10 year jail sentence along with his daughter and heir apparent for seven years, both convicted on charges of corruption.

Not that he is squeaky clean, but the unholy haste shown to put Sharif away just before the elections date smacks of political vendetta according to critics. The ubiquitous establishment answering charges of meddling in the process blandly claims that it has nothing to do with (managing the) elections. But those in the PML-N-and the PPP to a lesser extent claim that they have been consistently arm-twisted by middle to lower level sleuths.

Plans were slightly upset when contrary to expectations that Sharif on the pretext of tending to his ailing wife in London will not return to serve his jail sentence. But he surprised many by heading to Lahore along with his daughter.

The caretakers and the security agencies were constrained to put the city under siege. Mobile telephone services were suspended and the Rangers blocked major arteries by placing scores of containers on that fateful Friday.

The main purpose to block Sharif’s possible interaction with his supporters was achieved when as soon as he arrived he was successfully whisked away to Adiala Jail near Rawalpindi. But the whole operation further damaged the credibility of the upcoming elections.

Another collateral damage has been the credibility and impartiality (or rather lack of it) of the caretaker provincial government in Punjab. Headed by a respected former academic the chief minster and his cabinet never rose above their personal biases against the PML-N and in favour of the PTI.

Not that he is squeaky clean, but the unholy haste shown to put Sharif away just before the elections date smacks of political vendetta according to critics

Some of the cabinet members of the Punjab caretaker setup are in fact cardholder members of the PTI. In the meanwhile scores of PML-N workers are being held either without any charges or on spurious grounds. Those who had assumed the days of preventive detentions harking back to military rules are in a state of shock.

No stone is being left unturned to ensure victory of the King’s party at the hustings. But yet there are apprehensions in some quarters that the PML-N despite the odds heavily stacked against it might just bag enough seats to remain a major player.

Perhaps the PML-N president Shahbaz Sharif is reading too much into the lackluster crowds at the Khan’s recent election meetings. But the PTI chief is rightly hopeful that he will be able to sweep the elections and form a government on his own strength in the parliament. This is quite possible but not without some favourable tailwind from the powers that be.

The conventional wisdom is a hung parliament. But many a time the war gamers have been proved wrong in the past. In the 1970 elections it was not being anticipated that Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto with his newly formed rag tag PPP would sweep in West Pakistan and Sheikh Mujeeb Ur Rehman in East Pakistan.

More recently general Musharraf in the 2002 elections carved out PML-Q from the leaderless PML-N and the Patriots from the PPP. Despite the intensely overt engineering the King’s party could barely scrape through to form a government.

In the present scenario despite concerted efforts to break the back of the PML-N it is largely intact. In Baluchistan the overnight emergence of BAP (Baluchistan Awami Party) earlier in the year was a new phenomenon without which the PML-N could not have been deprived of a majority in the Senate, thus enabling it to amend the constitution to its own advantages.

Similarly the now defunct Janoobi Punjab Sooba Mahaz (South Punjab Province Front) comprised of turncoats will go the way the wind blows, just like a weathercock.

Another interesting development to watch is how some of the jehadists and sectarian outfits fare in the elections. Of course some of these proscribed organizations were overnight dry cleaned to participate in the elections. Perhaps their assigned role is to play the ubiquitous spoiler.

In the past such infantile strategies have boomeranged. The Taliban and the MQM were created as a result of this very mindset.

PML–N senators including Pervez Rashid and Mushahid Hussain Syed have demanded that the election commission of Pakistan (ECP) and the caretaker government address their concerns about fairness of the election process urgently. Perhaps it is too late in the day for the PML-N senators to complain, as the die has already been cast.

Those who had assumed the days of preventive detentions harking back to military rules are in a state of shock

In the Islamic Republic, this is an age of Orwellian doublespeak. Everything including the elections is ostensibly being conducted to strengthen democracy. But the real – albeit unstated – purpose is to achieve just the opposite.

George Orwell in his eerily futuristic novel Nineteen Eighty-Four about the powers of a totalitarian state never used the word “double speak”. Nonetheless doublespeak came to be known as: a language that deliberately obscures disguises or reverses the meaning of words.

Surely elections 2018 just might prove to be the ultimate Orwellian elections."

ISLAMABAD: A mixed result from Attock district is likely in the upcoming general election as a healthy competition is expected among the candidates contesting for the seats of the national assembly (NA) and provincial assembly (PA).

According to a preliminary revised delimitation list by ECP, Attock’s member of national assembly (MNA) seats have decreased from three to two, while the constituencies for Punjab Assembly have also witnessed a decrease from 8 to 7 seats. The total registered voters are 1,146,665 including 615,708 male and 530,957 female voters.

NA-55 Attock-II

In NA-55 of Attock district, the actual race is among three candidates out of many. The candidate of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) is a famous politician Major (r) Tahir Saddiq, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz’s (PML-N) candidate is Sheikh Aftab, and Zulfiqar Hayat is of Pakistan People’s Party (PPP).

At present, election campaigns of all three candidates are in full swings in the area. Although seasoned politician Sheikh Aftab of PML-N is considered to be a strong candidate to win NA-55, however, Major Sadiq has been giving the PML-N candidate a tough time with his strong election campaign. It is likely that Major Sadiq may win the constituency with a handsome margin as important families, groups, and panels have joined the ‘Major Group’.

NA-56 Attock-II

A strong fight is expected among five candidates who are Major Sadiq of PTI, Malik Sohail of PML-N, Pir Faisal Shahzad of Tehreek Labaik Ya Rasool Allah (TLY), Sardar Saleem Haider of PPP and independent candidate Malik Shaharyar Khan.

Each candidate is running his campaign with zeal, zest and the confidence that he will win with a majority of voters. However, a surprising result in favour of PPP candidate Sardar Saleem Haider is largely anticipated, especially after the PPP co-chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s recent visit in the area in addition to, door to door campaigning.

Major Sadiq is popular among the public and is a strong candidate but he is participating from two constituencies and one provincial assembly seat that are NA-55 and NA-56. It is said that he will win one NA seat and one provincial assembly seat from the district.

Another strong candidate is Malik Sohail from PML-N. Malik had earlier joined PTI but left the party due to some differences with Major Sadiq.

Malik Shahryar Khan is an independent candidate launched by famous ‘Khonda Group’ of the district after he was refused a ticket by PML-N. The Khonda family is the owner of 84 villages of the district, while ‘Khonda Group’ has a handsome vote bank in the entire district. Malik Shaharyar Khan is the son of former MNA and head of ‘Khonda Group’ Malik Allah Yar Khan.

PP-I Attock

Six candidates are contesting from PP-I and a tough competition is expected here. A tough competition is likely particularly between PTI’s Yawar Bokhari and an independent candidate Malik Hameed Akbar. Other candidates include Sheikh Salman Sarwar of PML-N and Malik Iqbal of MMA who are also in the run but the neck to neck competition will be between Bokhari and Malik Hameed.

PP-II Attock

Despite the participation of several candidates, a tough competition is likely among four candidates who are Qazi Ahmed Akbar of PTI, Jahangir Khanzada of PML-N, Ahmed Taj Khanzada of PPP and Changez Khan of MMA.

It is relevant to mention that so far, Khan and Taj Khanzada have gained a strong position during the election campaign. Changez Khan is said to be the right-hand man of Major Sadiq and it is estimated that he will give a tough time in the polls.

Also, Taj Khanzda being the son of the Khanzada family chief Taj Khanzada and contesting for the very first time on a PPP party ticket is in a strong position.

PP-III Attock

There is strong competition among three candidates of PP-III. These candidates include Major Sadiq, Haji Riaz Balrah of PPP and Advocate Asif Ali Malik who is a relative of Chaudry Nisar Ali Khan. So far, Major Sadiq has gained a strong position in the area and it is likely that he will win the provincial assembly seat from here.

Moreover, this is Major Sadiq’s native constituency.

PP-IV Attock

A healthy competition among four candidates is expected in PP-4 of Attock district. PPP has given party ticket to an old party worker Haji Akhtar to contest the election, while Chaudry Sher Ali, farmer provincial minister is ticket holder of PML-N, and Col. retd. Anwar is from PTI and Amanat Rawal has party ticket of TLY to give tough time to other competitors in the polls. At present, the position of TLY candidate, who is said very close to Major retd Tahir Saddiq, is strong. However, if Chaudry Sher Ali of PML-N succeeds in convincing angry groups and families who were with him in elections 2013 and senior leadership of PML-N pay visit in the area then he can win the seat but with a close margin.

PP-V Attock

Though there is a competition to win PP-5 seat among the candidates, actual competition on 5th July 2018 is expected among an independent candidate, PML-N candidate and PTI’s candidate. PML-N has awarded ticket to Sardar Bahadur and Jamshaid Altaf has PTI’s ticket while Pir Abbas Mohiuddin is participating in the election as independent candidate. All the candidates are currently engaged to acquire consent/approval of major groups and biradaries. So far, an independent candidate has gained major success in getting the approval of main groups/panels and biradaries of this constituency.

Independent candidate Pir Abbas Mohiuddin is giving a tough time to his rivals and there are greater chances of his success in next elections. Pir Abbas Mohiuddin is the son of farmer parliamentarian Pir Safiuddin who is a close relative of former prime minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani and the top man/’Gaddi Nasheen’ of the shrine of Makhad Sharif.

PPP candidate for NA-56 Sardar Saleem Haider is fully supporting the independent candidate and in return getting the vote bank of Pir Abbas Mohiuddin.

It is important to note here that wrong party ticket distribution by PTI might result in losing the PP-5 seat as party ticket holder Jamshaid Altaf belongs to Hassan Abdal and has no deep roots, linkages or vote bank in the area."

THATTA: Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari Monday said that after coming into power, his party would provide food cards to the masses.

Bilawal was speaking to his supporters in Gharo city of Thatta district while campaigning for the forthcoming elections. He said that they had presented their manifesto, noting that the party initiated revolutionary programmes like Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).

“PPP has always served the people and now I will resolve public issues by myself,” he said and added, “We will provide food cards to masses through which they will get subsidised food.”

Bilawal told the participants that he needed their support and urged them to become his arms. “I want to change the fate of the country, and if the people are with us, then no one can stop us,” he said.

The PPP chief said that eliminating hunger was a part of his party’s manifesto. “We will open food centres in every area, which will be run by women.”

Undeterred by a mob attack on his caravan a day earlier during his electoral rally in Karachi’s Lyari neighbourhood, Bilawal hit the city’s roads once again early Monday.

“PPP does not believe in the politics of violence,” the PPP chairman said, as he stepped out of his car en route to interior Sindh to address supporters.

“My warm welcome in Lyari did not go down well with opposing parties,” he added.

Speaking to supporters in Quaidabad, he said that stones were pelted at his rally on Sunday under a conspiracy.

26,Elections 2018: Parties resort to monotonous campaigning in Rawalpindi,https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/06/29/elections-2018-parties-resort-to-monotonous-campaigning-in-rawalpindi/,"RAWALPINDI: With the elections, just a few weeks away, the campaigning for various parties has been limited to posters and banners due to the high temperature in the city and the lack of interest from the locals in Rawalpindi, a local media house reported.

This had been visible throughout the city as the election momentum has not yet been picked up by the party workers, thus resorting to the monotonous campaigning concept.

According to the local media report, during the previous elections in 2013, parties like Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) established its central elections office on Liaquat Road, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Murree Road and the Pakistan Muslim League -Nawaz (PML-N) on both.

However, as of now, the parties are more interested in settling disputes over the distribution of party tickets than actively campaigning for their candidates.

Other than Awami Muslim League’s Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, who has opened Lal Haveli to the public, political parties in the city have not made decisions on their elections schedule or central offices yet.

A senior PPP leader stated that the candidates are not willing to spend money. thus the party’s popularity in the city is not visible. Moreover, no plans for any public meetings had been decided.

Former PML-N MNA Malik Shakil Awan said electioneering was limited to door-to-door and street campaigning, and an election office would be established by the National Assembly candidate soon.

Former PTI MPA Arif Abbasi also admitted to a lack of momentum in the party’s campaigning because of a lack of interest on the part of candidates and workers.

During the 2013 elections, campaigning began two months earlier, with the inauguration of the PTI’s central office by Chairman Imran Khan. This time, however, the party was not interested in the work needed to establish a central office that will coordinate with all seven National Assembly constituencies in the district."

According to a local media report, the decision was made in accordance with article 62 and 63 of the Constitution during the hearing of an appeal against the approval of Jalali’s nomination papers for NA-81 Gujranwala constituency.

Moreover, the tribunal termed the returning officer’s decision as null and void. At the same time, it allowed former state minister Saira Afzal Tarar to contest the upcoming general election.

A voter from NA-87 (Hafizabad) had filed an appeal against the decision of the returning officer saying Tarar concealed details of her properties in nomination papers. However, the tribunal dismissed the appeal and upheld the decision of the returning officer.

PML-N’s covering candidate from NA-81 (Gujranwala), Atif Farid Sabir challenged the nomination papers of Maulana Jalali accusing him of not disclosing information about his income tax return.

He said Jalali had also failed to submit his passport to the returning officer despite an order issued by the Supreme Court. He said the returning officer had ignored the facts and accepted nomination papers of Jalali.

The tribunal accepted the appeal and set aside the decision of the returning officer disqualifying Maulana Jalali to contest the polls."

30,General Elections 2018: A war on social media,https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/06/23/general-elections-2018-a-war-on-social-media/,"ISLAMABAD: The emergence of social media has changed the course of election campaign altogether and has become the ubiquitous source of communication for candidates during election campaigns.

In the past, if the candidates wanted to reach voters during election campaigns, they used to hand out leaflets, knock on doors, hold corner meetings and drive around in vans speaking through loudspeakers.

Platforms like Facebook and Twitter enable candidates to directly reach out to voters, mobilize supporters, and influence the public agenda. These fundamental changes in political communication, therefore, present election candidates with a wide range of strategic choices.

The political parties earlier invested heavily in electronic and print media during election campaigns to get due coverage of their political activities, however, they can now convey their messages to the public to a greater extent, within no time, through social media with little investment.

So keeping in view the importance of social media, sources told Pakistan Today that various mainstream political parties have hired services of social media professionals and volunteers in order to reach out to the maximum number of people for the forthcoming general elections.

Though the political parties have yet to start formal electioneering because they have not finalised the process of distribution of tickets, their respective social media teams have already started vigorous campaigning on Facebook and Twitter.

All major political leaders especially Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan, Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Maryam Nawaz are the regular users of Twitter and have a great following.

However, PTI Chairman Imran Khan is the most popular leader on micro-blogging website Twitter in Pakistan with his followers reaching 8.03 million. Hence his tweets’ likes reach thousands within a few minutes. Maryam Nawaz comes second with more than 4.73 million while Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has 2.72 million followers on Twitter.

Similarly, the three political parties have official party accounts on Twitter as well on which PTI took the lead as its followers are 3.53 million while PML-N and PPP have mere 94,400 and 54,800 followers respectively.

Moreover, on Facebook too, the PTI has managed to maintain its supremacy as PTI chairman’s page is the most popular with 8.2 million followers while official PTI account has 5.8 million followers. On the other hand, Maryam Nawaz Sharif’s official page has 267,147 followers while PML-N’s Facebook page has 2.6 million followers.

Similarly, PPP’s official page on Facebook has over 195,663 followers while Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s Facebook followers are 156,655.

PTI is running an election campaign on social media with hashtag #WazireAzamImranKhan and #PTIrulesKP, while PML-N and PPP have highlighted development works done during the last five years to garner support for the upcoming polls.

PTI is also highlighting PTI government’s previous performance in KP in a unique way as trucks have been prepared with video screens and sound systems to present the performance of KP government to the people of the province during the election campaign.

These parties, however, refused to disclose their strategy when Pakistan Today contacted them."
31,Elections 2018,https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/06/21/elections-2018-2/,"Once again, the ROs

During 2013 elections the Returning Officers asked all sorts of irrelevant and funny questions to gauge the depth of the candidates’ religious knowledge, using Article 62 as an excuse, till barred by the Lahore High Court from seeking unnecessary information . This time again the ROs seem to have been provided no uniform standard to examine the nomination papers. This has led to the rejection of the papers of some of the leading contestants that include former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and PTI chief Imran Khan from NA-53 Islamabad. It was maintained that Abbasi had not submitted complete tax returns with his documents. It is difficult to believe that a man who has been elected six times to the National Assembly would submit incomplete documents. Imran Khan’s papers were rejected for failing to fill a column in the affidavit in which he was required to describe his performance as an MNA. This is surprising as papers of several legislators who never spoke a single word in the NA sittings have been accepted. Interestingly Khan’s nomination papers were validated by the ROs for NA-35 Bannu, NA-243 Karachi and NA-131 Lahore. There was a need for the ROs to be following a uniform policy in all constituencies. One hopes the Appellate Tribunals would undo the injustice.

A perception is fast growing that a particular party is being treated as more equal than others. The way a telephone call from Imran Khan led the interior secretary to remove the name of Zulfi Bukhari from the black list temporarily without even consulting NADRA has sent a message to the accountability body and bureaucracy that the PTI is to be treated as a favourite. The promise to reshuffle bureaucracy also follows a demand made by the PTI. The first woman to hold Punjab AGP office was removed from post because she was not acceptable to PTI. This has led LHBA to condemn the arbitrary removal calling it an “abuse of discretion and a blatant violation of due process”. Despite all these factors favourable to it the PTI remains perturbed over the outcome of the elections. The party is presumably upset over its failure to generate a popularity wave among the electorate."

The PSP chief also alleged that funds allocated for water and sanitation were being used in election campaigns.

–Mainly due to Ramzan and blistering heat, denizens of Islamabad remain politically aloof

ISLAMABAD: While the caretaker setup is in place, General Elections 2018 are only a month and a half away and the political temperature is reaching feverish heights by every passing day. The denizens of the capital, however, remain aloof from the election flurry as despite the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI), Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) finalising their candidates and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) almost done selecting its own, city level campaigning remains invisible due to the sweltering heat of June and Ramzan.

PTI’s finalised candidates include Raja Khurram Nawaz who will contest from NA-52, PTI supremo Imran Khan who will contest from NA-53 and sitting Member National Assembly (MNA) from NA-48 Asad Umer who is to contest from NA-54.

The PPP too has finalised its candidates; Afzal Khokar is to be the party’s candidate from NA-52, Sibt-ul-Haider Bukhari from NA-53 and brother of former prime minister (PM) Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, Raja Imran Ashraf will contest from NA-54.

As PML-N’s top tier is embattled in various cases in the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) court, various party factions are at loggerheads for the party’s ticket at local level. In the current situation, Tariq Fazal Chaudhary has surfaced as the strongest contender to contest from two seats of the capital namely NA-52 and NA-53. While former MNA Anjum Aqeel Khan is a strong contender for a ticket against Asad Umer of PTI in NA-54 and Mian Aslam of Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) for NA-52 and NA-53.

The rural urban divide played in PML-N’s favour during the last general elections, as well as, local bodies elections. It is yet to be seen how the new delimitation will affect this paradigm.

With banners placed few and far between roads and pavements, lone hoardings and half hearted meetings between candidates being the current atmosphere, it is expected that the federal capital will be gripped by election fever immediately after Eid. As per the data from returning officers, 172 individuals have received forms from three constituencies of Islamabad and more candidates are expected to submit their forms by the deadline on June 11.

“With Imran Khan contesting the elections from NA-54, we will execute his campaign 24/7. The citizens of the capital will ensure the victory of IK and other candidates as he is the only hope left for our country and the multiple problems that people face,” said Shumail Abrar, an engineer working in the private sector.

Islamabad previously had two constituencies namely NA-48, which was largely urban and NA-49, which was predominantly rural areas and had a few housing societies. However, another constituency was added after the latest delimitation and at present the capital has three constituencies namely NA-52, NA-53 and NA-54, which are home to 700,744, 670,683 and 630,152 people according to the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) data.

It is pertinent to mention here that the new constituency is carved out of what was previously NA-49. Along with some parts of NA-48 that is Islamabad’s other National Assembly (NA) constituency. The new constituencies of NA-52 and 53 constitute what was previously NA-49."

Hearing a case, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Mian Saqib Nisar inquired about the about the provision of vote facility to overseas Pakistanis. To this, lawyer Faisal Chaudhry said that there is a high possibility that the overseas Pakistanis won’t be able to vote in the upcoming elections.

“The steps carried out for voting by overseas Pakistanis should continue whereas the efforts of the court in this regard are commendable,” the counsel said.

“It is correct that this procedure is not possible right now. I tried to provide this facility to the overseas Pakistanis. But it will cause an immense loss at this point,” remarked the CJP.

The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) secretary told the court that as per a third-party evaluation, the e-voting project for the expatriates could not be accomplished. “At the moment, they cannot be given the voting facility. There is a need to work more over the online system,” he explained.

The CJP directed to make the task force report public. “The e-voting process can be reviewed in by-polls,” he maintained.

However, Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) has been safe from the internal rift with the party as it hardly found suitable candidates for the three National Assembly seats.

After the recent delimitation, the number of NA seats in Islamabad has increased from two to three – NA-52, 53 and 54.

The central leadership of PML-N took notice of the rifts and directed local leaders to attend the workers’ convention. Moreover, Anjum Aqeel and Syed Zeeshan Naqvi met to discuss this matter further.

According to a local media report, PML-N central leadership wants to award ticket to Anjum Aqeel for NA-54 as they believe that he could give a tough time to PTI’s Asad Umar.

However, the PML-N is facing internal rifts over the award of tickets in NA-53 and NA-54.

For NA-53 both the PML-N and PTI are facing grouping over the allocation of tickets.

PTI chief wanted to award ticket to Amir Kiani, whereas the local PTI leadership thinks that the ticket should be given to Chaudhry Ilyas Mehrban, who in 2013 elections bagged over 57,000 votes against PML-N’s Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry. Former PPP senator Babar Awan is also in the race for getting a party ticket from NA-53.

On the other hand, the PML-N has not decided a candidate for allocation of the ticket for NA-53 as the local chapter of the party and a majority of elected chairmen are supporting Sajid Abbasi.

For NA-52, there is no serious clash for allocating the ticket as PML-N is keen on getting Dr Tariq Fazal, while PTI is considering Raja Khurram Nawaz.

Jamaat-e-Islami is also facing grouping over the allocation of tickets as its former candidate from NA 49 Zubair Farooq is seriously considering contesting as an independent candidate from NA 54 while former MNA Mian Aslam is likely to contest from both NA 54 and NA 53."

PTI Spokesperson Fawad Chaudhry said, “PTI has so far received more than 41,000 applications and the party will field candidates for all 272 seats of the National Assembly.”

It had further been reported that the party would distribute tickets to its candidates from Islamabad on May 31, those from Punjab on June 2 and 3, those from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on June 4, those from Sindh on June 5, and those from Balochistan on June 6.

The PTI spokesperson further stated that the party had formulated a set of eligibility criteria for choosing the best candidate from among the applicants as the party is facing difficulty in distributing the tickets.

“They have come mostly from the constituencies where the PTI candidates lost the 2013 elections with a margin of more than 20,000 votes. Therefore, this time the party is considering fielding the newcomers in these places,” the PTI spokesperson said.

He further mentioned that PTI Chairman Imran Khan had already announced that the party would not enter into an alliance for the elections, adding that the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid, Pakistan Awami Tehreek and Jamaat-e-Islami had approached the chief for forming alliances but he had turned down their requests.

Earlier, while addressing his party’s central and provincial leaders at a function in Karachi, Khan said, “PTI had become the focus of nation’s aspirations; so he had decided to award party tickets himself to strong candidates on merit.”

He was of the opinion that solution to all the problems faced by the country lay in the success of the PTI in the coming elections."
41,PPP can win one NA seat from Attock district in elections 2018,https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/05/06/elections-2018/,"Main hurdle removed

With the publication of the final delimitations of constituencies’ list, the only imponderable in the timely elections has been eliminated. The decision by the ECP cannot be challenged in any court. Earlier in March, both the CJP and COAS had been quoted that if the delimitation wasn’t finished on time this might lead to the postponement of elections. The ECP had however assured that it would complete the task well within time, a pledge it has redeemed.

As it is common in Pakistan for the rumour mill to start grinding conspiracy theories, statements attributing motives behind a possible postponement of elections came both from the legal community and politicians. A Pakistan Bar Council executive member expressed fears that the judiciary might be used to postpone elections. He wrote a letter to all 22 representatives of the legal fraternity’s apex body, calling upon them to pass a strong resolution to resist any move to postpone the upcoming elections. Javed Hashmi’s fertile imagination brought forth another doomsday scenario. He maintained that a caretaker government would be formed without consultation with the prime minister and leader of the opposition and the SC with the caretaker set up would postpone the elections for an indefinite period.

A perception is being formed that both Zardari and Imran Khan are dissatisfied about their electoral prospects. Zardari has suggested that dire necessity might lead the two to join hands against the PML-N after the elections. Postponement of the elections could be another way out. Two weeks back Sheikh Rashid predicted that the elections would be postponed “keeping in view the ongoing political climate of the country” and would be delayed to September or October. In his latest TV interview Imran Khan predicted the elections could be deferred by 30-45 days.

Both the SC and the ECP have promised to hold free, fair and timely elections. PM Abbasi’s lame duck government cannot effectively deal with the internal and external challenges faced by Pakistan. The IMF has underlined the problems the country could face if political uncertainty was to be prolonged. This requires elections to be held on schedule and an orderly handing over of power to the next elected set up."
42,Elections 2018: Bilawal promises food cards for masses,https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/05/01/likely-outcome-of-elections-2018/,"Shaky government on the cards

Although Pakistan’s Parliament completes its term in June 2018, the fresh consensus list at best can be used provisionally. In 2017, Pakistan’s parliament had passed The Elections Act 2017. To be in line with international standards, the Act places a limit on constitution variation not to exceed 10pc. For this consensus data needs to be officially published. This is the basic requirement to conduct fresh delimitation. Since there is no such publication, the political parties passed a Constitutional Amendment allowing ECP to use the provisional results. Using this and the Election Rules 2017 duly issued by ECP delimitation process have been underway since beginning of 2018.

Putting aside this technical hurdle that has to be overcome a number of other issues too looms large on the horizon.

Political alignments are undergoing a huge shift. No party seems to have an ideological stance and with PML-N’s legislators defecting, things do not look good for the ruling party. Many ‘electables’ have already ditched PML-N. Most have joined PTI. However, their departure from PML-N ranks for greener pastures is something one often sees with fresh elections looming. Many in PML-N joined the party post 2013 elections and many were earlier members of PML-Q. PML-N had opened its door for all shades of turncoats and now is being paid back in the same coin.

Then there are the independent candidates emerging as victors who can be used to render support to a party. That the party may not be PML-N is a foregone conclusion. The decision of Supreme Court ousting Nawaz Sharif as prime minister and subsequent cases being conducted by NAB are not a good omen for the party.

Provincial, regional, religious and ethnic colours have made the canvas murky. An example was the by-elections of NA 120. Ending up third was the Labbaik Party bagging 7,180 votes, followed by Milli Muslim League with 5,822 votes. Hussain Rizvi, candidate of Labbaik Ya Rasul Allah, managed to scoop 6pc of the votes cast. He campaigned in favour of stringent blasphemy laws. His posters claimed love and admiration of Mumtaz Qadri who killed the then Punjab Governor Salman Taseer. Upon this act, many religious factions declared Qadri a hero. Yaqoob Sheikh winning from Milli Muslim League platform; in 2012 was titled a terrorist by US managed to capture 5pc votes. MML is the political springboard of Hafiz Saeed’s JuD. Mosques were a favourite place of promoting their candidates by these Islamic based parties. Should these parties be made to renounce terrorism and violence in all forms, denounce militancy and de-weaponise and then be allowed to enter mainstream politics?

With Khawaja Asif’s disqualification for life for holding an Iqama by High Court (IHC) comes a big blow to PML-N and will likely have a negative cascading impact on PML-N leading to more legislators jumping the ship

On face of it — it seems the Parliament will be a hung one. Punjab is stronghold of PML-N. Six MNAs and two MPAs have already left PML-N from Rahim Yar Khan, Bahawal Nagar, Faisalabad, Gujranwala to name a few with the purpose of pursuing the demarcation for South Punjab thereby creating a new province.

With Khawaja Asif’s disqualification for life for holding an Iqama by High Court (IHC) comes a big blow to PML-N and will likely have a negative cascading impact on PML-N leading to more legislators jumping the ship.

It does not seem likely that PML-N will win parliamentary majority. It also does not seem likely that he will be able to garner support of other parties to win that majority. The odds are against it.

So what will happen?

Can PTI garner enough support with the help of extreme rightists, a mix of independents and cobbling together a mix of smaller groups to form a government? Will this group on issues be on the same page or lead to more chaos? How long will it survive? A broth made by too many cooks is bound to spoil.

How different parties manage the voters on Election Day is important as is galvanising supporters to come out to vote.

PPP has reduced itself to a sub-provincial party restricted to rural Sindh. If elections of NA-120 is anything to go by, PPP has very little standing outside of their niche. A most disturbing aspect of NA 120 elections had been the demise of PPP. This was the constituency which largely came under NW-60 in 1970 won by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto by 78,000 votes. His main contestant was Dr Javed Iqbal, son of Allama Iqbal. In 2017, PPP bagged only 1,404 votes. It ended up last in the race. A sad state for a party that had won the hearts and minds of people under the dynamic leadership of Bhutto.

The question is which of these weak parties manage to get the magical figure of 172 numbers and who will form the 172? Achievement of this goal is one thing, running a government successfully of a motley group of divergent thought processes thrown together is quite another.

It will be a system chaos.

End Note: “Good governance never depends upon laws, but upon the personal qualities of those who govern. The machinery of government is always subordinate to the will of those who administer that machinery. The most important element of government, therefore, is the method of choosing leaders.”

Election postponement rumours laid to rest: Khursheed Shah

LAHORE: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Shafqat Mehmood has confirmed that his party’s chairperson Imran Khan will not cast vote in the Senate elections.

While talking to the media outside the National Assembly, Shafqat Mehmood said Imran would not be going to the Parliament to cast his vote as he had other commitments.

Meanwhile, PTI Member Provincial Assembly (MNA) Shoaib Siddiqui accused the Punjab government of rigging in Senate elections. He alleged that members of the ruling party led by Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah stormed the polling booth and that ballot papers were being snuck out after casting empty votes in the ballot boxes.

“Election result should be declared null and void if empty slips are recovered from ballot boxes,” he demanded. The PTI member said he has also registered a protest with the presiding officer.

On the other hand, another PTI leader Raja Riaz asked for the vote in Senate polls from Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah.

According to details, Raja Riaz stopped Rana Sanaullah in Punjab Assembly when he was about to cast the first vote and asked him to give his vote to PTI.

In a response, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader smiled and left the place after the brief meeting.

Speaking to media outside the Punjab Assembly regarding PTI’s Senate election campaign, he stated, “Everything is fair in love and war. This is our election campaign and we have also asked the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) members to give votes to a person who has an international stature and is capable to deal with internal and external challenges faced by the country.”

MARRIYUM HOPEFUL FOR A SENATE CLEAN SWEEP

State Minister for Information Marriyum Aurangzeb said that opposition parties will not get a single seat in Senate.

Talking to media in Islamabad, Marriyum Aurangzeb said people always welcome ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif wherever he goes as he has done a lot for the general masses. She said that an elected PM was removed on the basis of Iqama. No evidence was found against Nawaz Sharif, she added.

The minister said that PML-N will emerge as the winner in today’s polls.

Opposition Leader in National Assembly (NA) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) member Khursheed Shah has said that the assemblies will complete their tenure and that the rumours about the postponement of elections will cease to exist after today’s Senate polls.

Meanwhile, PPP’s Sharjeel Memon said that his party has nominated hard working candidates for Senate elections, adding that National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) law in Punjab is different from other provinces.

He said that he will not criticize judiciary like ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif and Chief Minister of Punjab (CM) Shehbaz Sharif.

Former CM Sindh Qaim Ali Shah said democracy ensures freedom of every individual, continuing that the members will cast vote as per their wish.

PML-N Sindh leader Arbab Ghulam Rahim stated that the ruling party, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and PML-F would be supporting each other in the Senate elections.

Talking to press, the former chief minister claimed that a deal has been struck between the ruling party and the major opposition parties in Sindh.

He said the ruling party MPAs in Sindh Assembly would be supporting the candidates of PML-F for general seats and MQM-P for technocrat seats of the Senate and that “unwritten pacts” have been made among the opposition parties.

He said that PML-N believed in serving people and would continue its efforts for bringing prosperity and development in the country.

Senate elections 2018 will be drawing more attention than any other held so far. The biggest loser would be the PML-N and PPP and the biggest gainer the PTI. What needs to be watched is the extent of their gains and losses.

The unexpected parliamentary coup in Balochistan has upset PML-N’s plans for the future. The party had hoped that with both the NA and Senate under its control, it would be able to pass laws overriding some of the Supreme Court decisions that have caused the party a grave set back. Further, the PML-N would also be able to fall back on parliament’s support during the tenure of the three consecutive Chief Justices least liked by it who would hold office for most of the time till 2023 elections. The PML-F which, was on the brink of extinction in the Senate with all its four Senators retiring on March 11, is looking up for a new lease of life due to the change of government in Balochistan.

Besides losing 70 percent of its Senators who would retire, the PPP would also be deprived of some of its enlightened and articulate Senators that include Aitzaz Ahsan, Raza Rabbani, Farhatulah Babar and Taj Haider. When the reports of dissension in PML-N’s parliamentary committee in Balochistan became public party leaders in Punjab accused Zardari of pulling the strings but this was denied by the PPP. The meeting between Balochistan cabinet members led by CM Abdul Quddus Bizenjo and PPP leaders led by Zardari in Karachi suggests the rumours were not altogether false. It remains to be seen if the PPP, which has no legislator in Balochistan Assembly, can manage to get PPP Senators elected from the province.

The PTI which entered the Senate first time in 2015 would now double its seats to 14. Ishaq Dar would be the most prominent among the nine retiring PML-N Sentors. Mushahid Hussain Syed of the PML-F would be another prominent Senator to retire. There is a likelihood of the PML-N getting him re-elected on its ticket."

With PPP withholding its reservations on the provisional Census Report, the Senate has finally passed the Delimitation of Constituencies Bill. This removes the only hurdle which could have blocked timely elections. The rumour mills are left with little grist after the COAS made it clear that the army stood by democracy and he considered presidential system unsuitable for the country. Further that the army will carry out decisions taken by the Parliament. Thus the national government is no more than a pipe dream like the much talked about government of technocrats.

The delimitation of constituencies is reportedly already being conducted by the Election Commission (EC) on the presumption that the bill cleared by the National Assembly was finally going to be approved by the Senate. Consequently the EC will have smooth sailing now. One expects the present EC to put up a better performance than was witnessed in 2013 elections. It should be wiser after receiving inputs from the electoral reforms committee. A judicial Commission which probed complaints about 2013 elections also pointed out a number of weaknesses and shortcomings in the electoral system. The complaints regarding candidates spending huge mounts on campaigns, thus queering the pitch for the middle class contestants, need to be redressed in the upcoming polls. Unless the EC takes a firm stand on lowering election expenses the perception that legislative bodies have turned into millionaires’ clubs would continue to persist taking away much of the sheen from democracy.

It is presumed that the EC would be ready to hold the elections by the end of July or early August. It is time political parties put an end to protest marches and sit-ins and instead concentrate on preparing well thought out, realistic and forward looking election manifestos. Attempts should be made by the mainstream parties to reach a consensus on long gestation socio-economic policies and outstanding issues like population control so that these continue to be implemented irrespective of which one of them is in power."

In the last few weeks it seems that election campaigns have been started by Nawaz Sharif, Asif Ali Zardari, and Imran Khan to once again start selling dreams that they don’t have the capability or the desire to deliver.

Nawaz Sharif is spending the future earnings of the nation on extravagant projects at extravagant costs. He is burdening the future generations with one of the largest debts to pursue his ideas of grandiose.

Asif Ali Zardari sees a heaven in Sind standing at his balcony in Larkana, Anything not done is the fault of the federal government and lack of funds rather than his own government’s fault. Almost 10 years of his party rule is not enough for it. He needs one more term. His government in Sindh can threaten to shut off the gas when his own interests are at stake but his hands are tied when it comes to interests of people of Sindh.

Imran Khan keeps telling people that the police force is now independent and free to act. But the police was standing idly by watching the brutal killing of an innocent student in Mardan. Imran Khan has also funded a madrassah with a long history of extremist views and changed the curriculum to accommodate his extreme right allies to remain in government. Not only that, he has allied himself with the same status quo politicians rather than offer new leadership to the nation.

The politics of cults: All for one – and one for himself

Here, I am not blaming the parties – just these individuals. The parties are practically non-existent because the capable members refuse to stand up and prefer to remain loyal to these individuals rather than the ideals or principles of the party as a whole.

Raza Rabbani made a public statement stating that he will not preside over sanctioning of military courts as Chairman of Senate. But he then did precisely that – although he openly cried when he did it the first time. He had to succumb to the wishes of the party chief rather than the pursuit his ideals. His loyalty seems to be with the party head rather than of the party or the nation.

Aitzaz Ahsan kept narrating revolutionary verses but kept quite when he could have pursued corruption of the politicians in the Panama case because his party bosses told him to stay out of it. A similar situation prevails in the family enterprise of PML-N and the cultish culture of PTI.

This is an unsustainable situation and cannot go on for long if we want to save our country from disintegration. Provinces are not cards that can be exploited for political benefits. Rather, they have real people with have real needs. Capable people in political parties have to rise up and stand for their principles and ideals.

When you talk the talk …

As a member of PTI, I have always tried to stand up for principles even if I had to oppose my own party Chief. So I am not merely making suggestions to activists of other parties. I have walked the walk throughout my association with the party at the cost of being denied party tickets and positions. I have no regret about that and will continue doing it.

PTI can’t win next elections unless it offers a new vision, develops policies that reflect that vision and show the capability to execute it as well when in power. I advise Chairman Imran Khan to create a manifesto committee and I would like to be part of it. It is my responsibility to offer my services and it is the right of Chairman Imran Khan to accept or reject them. But whatever committee is formed should be based on party constitution. I, for one, would not accept any role in an unconstitutional committee."

Official documents available with Pakistan Today reveal that managers of all three presses, including Printing Corporation of Pakistan (PCP), Pakistan Security Printing Corporation (PSPC) and Pakistan Post Foundation Press (PPF), have expressed inability to print more than 200 million ballot papers during a meeting with Election Commission Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Raza.

The meeting took place on September 26, 2016, to discuss the arrangements for the printing of ballot papers to be used in upcoming general elections.

The managers had communicated inability to print required ballot papers due to old and low capacity printing machines.

According to present printing capacity of three big presses of the country, the PCP can print only 54mn ballot papers, the PSPC can print 75mn, and the PPF can print 60mn ballot papers (large size ballot) and 90mn (single column ballot) ballot papers by working 20 hours per day in 20 days.

The documents also disclosed that the Cabinet Division had submitted a summary to the premier for allocation of appropriate funds (Rs864 million) to obtain 16 new two colour printing machines with an automatic numbering facility to increase the printing capacity of PCP to print 153.60 mn ballot papers in 20 days in addition to the existing capacity and resultantly the PCP would be able to print total up to 207.60 mn ballot papers.

General elections-2018 is scheduled to be held anytime in the country within 90 days after June 5, 2018. And, preparations and arrangements made so far in this regard clearly tell that an old method of voting through ballot papers is likely to be adopted in next general elections to dupe the gullible.

Interestingly, after previous general elections held in May 2013, all political parties except ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) blamed that the elections were rigged.

They all urged the government to bring reforms in the electoral system by introducing modern technologies.

And, an introduction of electronic voting machines (EVMs) and biometric verification (BVMs) was part of bringing reforms in the electoral system. However, the government and opposition sides have so far shown a lack of interest regarding bringing reforms in the electoral system of the country.

Furthermore, the inability of three presses of the country to print enough ballot papers calls for the government attention besides, allocation of appropriate funds to procure 16 new printing machines. Also, there is need to introduce electronic voting in those parts of the country where 3 G and 4 G technology is available to make the election a fair, transparent and trustworthy exercise in the country."

At a gathering of key election stakeholders on Tuesday, FAFEN indicated that it will start observing pre-election processes from April 2018 by mobilizing more than 6,000 citizen observers across the country. FAFEN’s pre-election observation methodology will be based on international best practices, national law, and Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP)’s code of conduct for candidates and political parties.

Abiding by the ECP code of conduct for observers, FAFEN observers will report on political alignments, whether there is a “level playing field” for all political contestants, participation of women and marginalized communities, inappropriate use of public resources, development schemes, postings and transfers, the candidate nomination process, campaign financing and content, political violence, polling scheme formulation and other ECP preparations for election administration, and resolution of election complaints.

On Election Day, FAFEN plans to deploy 16,000 specially-trained and duly accredited observers nationwide. They will observe and report on election management, including whether all polling stations and booths (especially for women) are set up as in the polling scheme, the environment around polling stations including illegal campaigning and law and order, as well as voting, ballot counting and election result consolidation processes.

FAFEN’s Election Day methodology will also enable it to produce a “Parallel Vote Tabulation” for each NA constituency based on vote counts collected directly from a statistically valid sample of polling stations.

After the elections, FAFEN will collaborate with lawyers to observe and study the establishment, proceedings and decisions of Election Tribunals. Based on this post-election observation, FAFEN will report on the quality and speed with which election result disputes are settled.

To keep stakeholders and citizens updated on its observations of each stage in the electoral process, FAFEN will produce periodic reports, daily updates and dissemination of observation findings online and through social media.

Based on FAFEN’s experience of observing two preceding General Elections in 2008 and 2013, the network has further refined its observation methodologies and reporting mechanisms to strengthen its essential and unique contribution to elections in Pakistan."

ISLAMABAD: The overall score of quality of General Election 2018 stands at 51.79% which has dropped nearly 5 percentage points from the quality of General Election 2013 assessed to be at 56.76%, an assessment conducted by Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (PILDAT) regarding the quality of polls found.

The institute has proposed an investigation into those aspects of the election about which a number of questions have been raised by various political parties and candidates.

According to the assessment, the quality of General Election 2018 has been assessed under four broad categories: 1) Pre-Poll; 2) Polling; 3) Counting of Votes, Compilation & Transmission of Results and 4) Post-Poll phase.

While Pre-Poll Phase received an overall score of 50%, the Polling day operations and arrangements for voting received the highest score of 64%. Counting, Result Compilation & Transmission of Results received the lowest score of 40% in the assessment and the Post-Poll phase received the score of 50%.

The assessment is briefed below:

PRE-POLL PHASE: While the quality of Pre-Poll Phase has received an overall score of 50%, it has declined nearly 12 percentage points in comparison to the quality of pre-poll phase of GE 2013 which had received a score of 62.35%. While PILDAT had already carried out an analysis of perception of pre-poll fairness in May 2018 terming it Unfair, the score assigned in this assessment has been based on the period between April to July 2018 and in particular is low on the parameters of neutrality of the federal and provincial caretaker governments, impartiality of the intelligence agencies and independence of the Judiciary.

POLLING DAY: The PILDAT assessment shows improved Polling-day Operations in GE 2018 compared to GE 2013 in terms of training and impartiality of polling staff and overall management of the polling arrangements for citizens as the process received an overall score of 64% It must be noted that in terms of polling day management, a steady improvement is recorded since 2002 and 2008 when the process received a score of 40% respectively, improving to 44% in 2013 and now to 64% in 2018.

COUNTING: Counting, Result Compilation & Transmission of Results have received the lowest score of 40% in the assessment. It must be noted that this is not just the lowest score for any single aspect of the quality of General Election 2018 but it is also the lowest score in comparison to the processes adopted in 2002, 2008 and 2013 when the similar process received scores of 43% respectively in 2002 and 2008 and improving to 47% in 2013 General Election which has, in 2018 General Election, plummeted to 40%. Each parameter under the Counting, Result Compilation & Transmission of Results including strict legal requirements of transparency of compilation of Statement of Vote Count, availability of Results to Polling Agents and Display at Polling Stations, Efficiency and Accuracy of the Transmission of Election Results from polling stations to Returning Officers, Transparency of Consolidation of Results at RO level and Efficiency and Accuracy of transmission of results from ROs to the ECP has been called into question.

POST-POLL PHASE: The Post-Poll Phase has also seen declining score of 50% compared to the score assigned to the similar process after the GE 2013 which stood at 68%. Again, the assessment of the quality of this process shows that while the lowest score assigned to this process was 40% after General Election of 2002, which saw the worst-of-its-kind post-poll rigging in recent history, the score improved after GE 2008 to 56%, recorded significant further improvements with the score of 68% after General Election 2013 and has now recorded a decline even lower than GE 2008. This decline in the quality of Post-election score compared to GE 2013 may partly be attributed to the fact that PMLN had gained a clear majority in the National and Provincial Assembly of Punjab in GE 2013 and it did not need to make intense efforts to win the support or joining of independent legislators to form the government.

The PILDAT Assessment of Quality of General Election 2018 is a continuation of earlier similar assessments that have been carried out by the think tank after General Elections of 2002, 2008 and 2013. Similar assessments in the past assigned the overall score of 37.30% to the quality of General Election 2002 and 40% to the quality of GE 2008. The scores improved for the quality of General Election 2013 at 56.76% but have dropped again to 51.79% for the quality of General Election 2018. This drop in the quality is mainly due to Poor Quality of Pre-poll phase which is largely attributable to the factors lying outside the direct remit of the ECP, the institute found."
56,Elections 2018,https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/07/19/report-terms-2018-polls-as-dirtiest-elections-in-years/,"Pakistan is heading for one of its “dirtiest elections in many years”, observers and political campaigners have warned, with candidates alleging widespread interference by the country’s powerful army, a report published in Financial Times said.

The report mentions Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) members who claimed to have been “targeted by members of the intelligence services”.

Talking to the FT, former premier Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said, “There has been coercion on members of our party to switch sides, with many of them being threatened with corruption cases.”

“This is shaping up to be the worst election since 2002 — people have begun treating it as a joke,” Abbasi added.

The report sheds light on the hostility between the PML-N and the army, calling it all-time high after Nawaz Sharif was ousted as prime minister and party leader on corruption charges that his allies say were orchestrated by the military.

RISING CIV-MIL TENSIONS:

PML-N government remained in power until parliament was dissolved in May in preparation for the election under a caretaker government. Last week Mr Sharif was jailed for 10 years in a judgment that could see him unable to campaign during the election.

Meanwhile, many members of his party said they had been called by people they believed to be working for the army and urged to switch allegiances.

Some said their movements had been monitored and occasionally obstructed, while others alleged they had been hounded through the courts. Abbasi’s own nomination papers were challenged in the Supreme Court, which eventually ruled in his favour.

HARASSMENT OF CANDIDATES:

The army has denied political interference, with Major General Asif Ghafoor, its spokesman, saying it would play its role in a “non-political and impartial manner”.

The PML-N is engaged in a two-way fight with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, the anti-corruption party led by Imran Khan, Pakistan’s former cricket captain. Mr Khan has denied allegations that he was being backed by the country’s powerful generals, and has condemned any harassment of election candidates.

Presuming the vote goes ahead as planned, it will be only the second time Pakistan has made a transition from one civilian government to another. But the security of the election process has been thrown into doubt by a string of attacks on election rallies, including one in Mastung that killed 149 people.

Some accuse the army of not doing enough to provide security for political candidates, while others accuse it of outright harassment.

Concerns about the treatment of the PTI’s main opponents, including the Pakistan People’s Party and the Awami National Party, have prompted Pakistan’s human rights commission to issue a damning report into the election process.

The commission said this week it was “gravely concerned over what it sees as blatant, aggressive and unabashed attempts to manipulate the outcome of the upcoming elections”.

It said it was also concerned by the army’s plan to put 370,000 troops on the streets on polling day, compared with just 70,000 at the previous general election in 2013.

MEDIA CENSORSHIP:

Journalists said they were also coming under increased pressure to toe the army’s line, with those who failed to comply facing problems with distributing their news. In March, cable television services in certain areas of the country began blocking the transmission of the television station Geo, while the English-language Dawn newspaper said its sales networks had been disrupted.

Meanwhile, election observers from international organisations said their visas and government accreditations had been delayed for weeks, giving them only a few days on the ground before polling day next Wednesday.

“We have never had a situation like this in any of our 150-plus missions,” said Dmitra Ioannou, the deputy chief observer for the EU observation mission. “Usually our long-term observers would spend five to six weeks on the ground. This time, because of all the delays with our paperwork, they will get just one to two weeks, if that.”"

PUNJAB:

As far as provincial following is concerned, the polls revealed that PML-N remains the preferred party among voters in the largest province. However, PTI has gained moment and narrowed the gap with the passage of time.

IPOR poll, which focused only Punjab, found 51 per cent of respondents voting for the PML-N while 30 per cent confirming their vote for the PTI. 5 per cent of the respondents selected the PPP for 2018 polls.

KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA:

PTI remains the dominant party for voters in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), while PPP is ahead in Sindh. Both Gallup and Pulse converged that PTI could sweep the provincial seats in KP with 57 per cent support. PML-N and JUI-F were found to have lesser supporters than PTI.

BALOCHISTAN:

In Balochistan, there is a mixed support of three parties – PPP, MMA/JUI-F/PTI. PPP is the preferred party for voters in Balochistan in the Pulse survey. MMA and JUI-F are ahead of other parties, according to Gallup.

SINDH:

The PPP remained the most preferred party in Sindh in both Gallup and Pulse polls. They found no change in voter preference for the party from 2017 as 44 per cent of the voters still expressed that they would vote for the party. The PTI’s popularity among voters changed very little while 4 per cent said they would be voting for the PML-N in the province. The surveys concluded that the people of Sindh have remained loyal to the PPP."

Imran said that it is important to keep ground realities in consideration while electing a new party into power. He said that after the water crisis came to the fore, people are worried about the shortage of water.

According to media reports, the top brass of the PML-N has issued a ticket to his wife Mehnaz Akbar Aziz for NA-77 Narowal.

The former minister had earlier announced to field his father in the forthcoming election from his constituency but his father Anwar Aziz Chaudhry was already a PML-N ticket holder for provincial assembly seat from Narowal.

Daniyal Aziz then decided to field his wife from his constituency and the PML-N has also issued a ticket to Mehnaz Akbar Aziz.

SC FINDS DANIYAL GUILTY:

On Thursday, the Supreme Court found former federal privatisation minister Daniyal Aziz guilty of contempt of court and sentenced him till the rising of the court, which renders him disqualified to contest elections for a period of five years under Article 63 (1) (g) of the Constitution.

According to Article 63 (1) (g) of the Constitution, a person shall be disqualified from being elected or chosen as, and from being, a member of the Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament), if­ he has been convicted by a court of competent jurisdiction…unless a period of five years has elapsed since his release.

After Nehal Hashmi, Daniyal is second Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader who has been convicted in a contempt case.

A three-judge bench of the top court, which had taken suo motu notice of Aziz’s anti-judiciary remarks, heard the proceedings since February this year.

As the three-member bench, headed by Justice Gulzar Ahmed, convened to announce the verdict, Justice Mushir Alam, who was part of the original bench, was given the verdict for reading out.

Justice Alam, however, decided to wait for Aziz before announcing the verdict as the former minister had not arrived in court.

As Aziz later reached the top court, the court ruled that he committed contempt.

The court also ruled that it deliberately showed leniency and did not send Aziz to jail for six months under the law.

Aziz denied ever saying the words for which he was held in contempt. “I never said the words that were written in the newspaper and for which I was held in contempt,” he claimed.

Aziz argued that the contemptuous phrases on whose basis he was held in contempt were censored with a beep when they were aired in news bulletins, which according to Aziz, was akin to him not having said it.

“I have never violated the court’s orders,” he said. “In fact, me and my party have always implemented the court’s orders. To disagree is our right, we have always done that and will keep on doing it.”"
60,Elections 2018: Parties resort to monotonous campaigning in Rawalpindi,https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/06/26/larkanas-political-players-to-be-challenged-by-academician-in-2018-elections/,"KARACHI: Although contesting elections in Pakistan for provincial or national assembly seats require millions of rupees, the entrance of middle-class principal of a private college in politics has become what the political analysts believe is a ‘bitter pill’ for the influential feudal and political families in Larkana.

Liaquat Ali Mirani, who is commonly known as Ustad (master), has been working as principal of Bahria Foundation College in Ranipur. He filed his nomination papers to contest the upcoming general elections for PS-13 (Dokri-Badeh) against the decades-old feudal and most powerful politicians despite lacking the wealth to run the luxurious election campaign.

Mirani has vast experience in the education sector with his earlier jobs as principal of Army Public School in Dadu and as vice principal at Army Public School in Pano Aqil, district Ghotki.

Having no grudge against any political party (except those corrupt individuals), Mirani only wishes that well-educated and honest candidates from any political party should be voted to power who could serve the poor people of the province, ensure quality education, provide healthcare facilities, local government system can fight against Patwari culture and etc.

Usually, the constituency for provincial assembly PS-13 Dokri-Badeh remained within the lap of Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) since past couple of years and party’s nominated Aziz Jatoi used to get elected from the said constituency.

However, this time, PPP has sidelined Mr Jatoi and awarded party ticket to Hizbullah Bughio compelling Aziz Jatoi to part ways and announced that he would contest upcoming elections as an independent candidate. While, the opposition alliance – Grand Democratic Alliance – has awarded party ticket to Aadil Altaf Unnar, and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf to Shafqat Unnar on the same constituency.

While campaigning even on bicycle and donkey-cart, Liaquat Ali Mirani has mobilized students, writers, educated youth and the oppressed masses against the feudal lords since acceptance of his nomination papers for the constituency.

“The consistent poor governance, massive corruption worth billions of rupees, vanishing of province’s resources etc will ultimately result in providing a chance to middle class leaders to get elected against the corrupt mafias who have ruled the province since past ten years”, Mirani told Pakistan Today by phone from his Dokri, town of district Larkana.

“I have no funds to run lavish type of election campaigns like they (feudal) run. I have a motorcycle that requires Rs 100 petrol for my campaign while my friend Mr Jhatial has gifted me a megaphone worth Rs 2200 from Karachi”, Mirani added.

The politicians have ruined our system that included education, health, road infrastructure, electricity etc, he said, adding that he was using lower level tactics to ‘further mobilise’ (development of mind) of people of the constituency.

“The common people have been scared of feudal lords however the fear among the masses have been reduced remarkably as people have started questioning the influential leaders about their past performances”, Mirani went on to say.

“I really wish that people like Ayaz Latif Palijo, Dr Qadir Magsi, Abbasi family of district Larkana, Mirza family of Badin, Syed Jalal Mehmood Shah, Syed Zain Shah, and all other well-educated candidates be voted to power so that the basic issues of the people could be resolved without any delay”, he concluded."

The JuD launched its political front Milli Muslim League (MML) but it has not been yet registered with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).

With general elections approaching, the group decided to contest on the platform of a “dormant” political entity Allaha-u-Akbar Tehreek (AAT) registered with the ECP.

The JuD activists and sympathisers have taken the nomination papers from the ECP and are fielding their candidates on the platform of the AAT.

“MML president Saifullah Khalid and AAT chief Ehsan Bari have agreed to field joint candidates on the platform of ATT in the upcoming elections. Under the seat adjustment agreement, the MML will field more than 200 educated candidates. They will contest the elections on the AAT’s election symbol chair,” Ahmad Nadeem, an MML spokesperson, said.

He said there are many political figures who have joined the MML and it has awarded them AAT tickets.

Asked if Saeed plans to run as a parliamentary candidate in this election, the spokesman said: “No … Hafiz sahib has no such plans at the moment. The MML is taking part for the first time in the general elections and hopefully, we will make to the parliament.”

To a question, if any “significant leader” of the JuD would contest the election, he said: “Our priority is that those joining us from other political parties or educated youths in respective constituencies be given AAT tickets.”

He said the AAT will launch its political campaign once its candidates file nomination papers.

“We are hopeful that the people will elect our candidates,” he said.

It is believed that since the MML has hardly any chance to get registered with the ECP as the latter had announced the election schedule and issued election symbols, it had no other option but to contest the election on any ‘dormant’ entity like the AAT.

Earlier, MML president Saifullah Khalid had said: “We have decided to support the candidates of AAT in July 25 elections. We will play a role in the victory of those contesting on the symbol of a chair. To save Pakistan, patriotic people should be supported in the elections.”

Khalid said the MML had been denied registration in the ECP for the last 11 months but will take part in the polls by supporting AAT candidates.

The interior ministry had opposed enlisting of the MML as a political party arguing it’s an offshoot of Saeed’s JuD banned under a UN resolution.

The JuD formed MML at the time when Saeed was detained in Lahore. Saeed and his four aides – Abdullah Ubaid, Malik Zafar Iqbal, Abdul Rehman Abid and Qazi Kashif Hussain – were placed under house arrest in Lahore on January 30 under the anti-terrorism act.

The JuD was declared as a foreign terrorist organisation by the US in June 2014. The JuD chief also carries a USD 10 million American bounty on his head for his role in terror activities."

The notices were issued to the respondents by LHC’s Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh during the hearing of a petition regarding Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s statement in April, in which he vowed to protect the integrity of the upcoming Pakistan general elections in 2018.

The petitioner, Shahid Jamal, requested that the interim federal government, ECP and PTA should also be directed to regulate social media to ensure the democratic process is not harmed in the upcoming general elections.

In April, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had said, “There are important elections in India, in Brazil, in Mexico, in Pakistan, and in Hungary. And we want to make sure we do everything we can to protect the integrity of those elections.”

The 33-year-old internet mogul told the Congress that the company has new artificial intelligence tools to identify fake accounts, and plans to hire 20,000 people to work on security and content review by the end of 2018.

The Facebook CEO had also said political ads on the social media website will be required to specify the person or entity paying for the message, as part of the bid to curb outside election interference.

Zuckerberg’s comments had come following severe backlash after it was revealed that political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, gained access to the personal data of 87 million Facebook users."

Meanwhile, MQM-Pakistan leader Farooq Sattar has also warned earlier that his party could boycott the forthcoming elections if their reservations were not addressed.

“Elections cannot guarantee our survival; the injustices done to us are in front of everyone,” Sattar said.

He feared that the elections in Karachi could be ‘fixed’. “A conspiracy is being hatched in Karachi. It was not only a minus-one formula that changed the political atmosphere of the metropolis; rather it was a minus-MQM formula that was in the process,” he said in a candid discussion."

“This (2018 election) will be a referendum,” he clearly stated, asking the people whether they would accompany him against the ”disqualification ruled by five judges of Supreme Court”.

Nawaz Sharif also said that he will not let anyone disrespect the vote ‘again’, maintaining that efforts were being made to send him to jail.

“A prime minister who sincerely serves the country has never been able to hold their office,” Nawaz told the rally participants.

In a jibe at political rival Imran Khan, the PML-N supremo said that the nation will stop Imran rising to power by using a ‘backdoor.’

Signaling out the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan as the most coward man, he lamented that Imran, who had once said that he would never form an alliance with Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Co-Chairman Asif Ali Zardari, was in cahoots with the latter. He alleged that both PTI and PPP sabotaged the Senate elections.

“Imran voted for the arrow [PPP’s electoral symbol] in the Senate elections,” alleged Nawaz.

LAHORE: With the nearing of 2018 general elections in Pakistan, Twitter bots have soared in number and it seems as if every political party’s social media wing is actively enhancing its resources to promote the agenda at hand, Pakistan Today has observed.

Hundreds or even thousands of bots have been scattered across the social media platform whose sole purpose is to manipulate the users. Using Twitter bots, political parties aim to manufacture consent and develop favourable opinion to gain maximum votes.

When (allegedly) three girls speak to you at the same time 😆 pic.twitter.com/0JTmzdrbCR — Mansoor Ali Khan (@_Mansoor_Ali) March 31, 2018

A Twitter user expressed rage over the issue and demanded the social media giant to take notice of the matter. “It’s time @Twitter make a serious effort to crack down on PML-N fake bots operating online. Most of them use pictures of fake girls too.”

However, the issue is not limited to any single political front. Parties from both left and right-wings are suspected of relying on bots to propagate their messages. A number of Twitter trends seen daily are either sponsored or built using the automated help.

Quoting an anonymous social media executive of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), The Diplomat reported that almost “everyone is running fake Facebook accounts and Twitter bots” in Pakistan to keep “pace with what others are doing”.

Although Twitter announced in February that it would be cracking down on bots after changes to the API to massively reduce the impact of services that allow links and content to be shared across multiple accounts, the move also reduced some real user’s follower counts. The platform largely believes in making its tools apolitical.

“Twitter’s tools are apolitical, and we enforce our rules without political bias…we also take action on any accounts we find that violate our terms of service, including asking account owners to confirm a phone number so we can confirm a human is behind it,” it said.

GOVT TO BLAME?

Social media activists belonging to the PTI often accuse the rivals, especially the government, of unleashing the bots to counter unfavourable opinions. One Twitter user wrote, “PML-N always had a media cell and they were (still are) using for false propaganda against opposition by employing IT ppl creating BOTS on Twitter, fake followers etc. Now, they’re openly doing it.”

The opposition parties’ wings go on to accuse the PML-N of being involved in malpractices through the IT ministry. The ruling party could be purchasing user’s data to manipulate the 2018 elections due to its power over the IT ministry, a member of the rival social media wing claimed. Similarly, experts criticise the government over its failure to enact data protection laws.

On the other hand, the PTI is too accused of starting hashtag trends whenever faced with severe criticism. A Twitter user complained, “The reply to any fact-based criticism against PTI is to get PTI trolls/cyber troll/bots to ‘grab their keyboards’ and start a hashtag trend.”

According to Pew Research data, an estimated two-thirds of tweeted links to popular websites are posted by automated accounts, not human beings. The study adds that among popular news and current event websites, 66% of tweeted links are made by suspected bots.

Not very far away from Pakistan, The Time recently reported that thousands of bots appeared in Malaysia just after the midweek election date was announced.

TWITTER ACCOUNTS AT RISK:

Apart from bots, security concerns too haunt every single Twitter user in Pakistan. The platform itself advised the millions of users to change passwords after bug exposed them in plain text.

The company recommended that users should change their passwords out of an “abundance of caution,” both on the site itself and anywhere else they may have used that password, including the third-party apps like Twitterrific and TweetDeck.

“We recently found a bug that stored passwords unmasked in an internal log. We fixed the bug and have no indication of a breach or misuse by anyone. As a precaution, consider changing your password on all services where you’ve used this password,” it said in the latest blog."

Addressing a workers’ convention of the PML-N in Rahim Yar Khan, Hamza said that hard work like that of Nawaz Sharif besides public service was the most important thing needed to lead the masses.

He said that Imran Khan would not be able to mislead the people with his baseless allegations anymore and if votes in the Senate polls were sold in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), it was Imran himself who was responsible.

The PML-N leader also said that after criticising Lahore’s metro bus for five years, the KP government was now working on the same project in the province. Training guns on his opponents, Hamza questioned, “What kind of change can Imran Khan possibly bring with the help of loan defaulters and land mafia?”

While criticising the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), Hamza said the people had not forgotten how “Asif Ali Zardari looted the nation and each penny of his looted wealth would be recovered”. He also said that former president Zardari had visited China several times but the Chinese government only trusted Nawaz Sharif for its 46 billion dollar investment in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

“People know that from Daanish Schools to the IT University, every development project has been completed in Rahim Yar Khan. I wonder what sort of deprivation had been felt by certain lawmakers after spending funds for five whole years,” Hamza said while speaking about south Punjab.

He also said that if the people entrusted the PML-N once again in the 2018 elections, another phase of development would be launched from Karachi to Khyber.

Earlier, Hamza spent visited the IT University and Gymnasium in Rahim Yar Khan. He also met PML-N office bearers while provincial ministers, MNAs, MPAs as well as other party leaders accompanied him."

During the meeting, different matters of mutual interest including political issues and progress on development projects came under discussion.

Speaking at the occasion, Chief Minister Shehbaz, who is also the PML-N president, said that the people of KP had been deceived in the name of change and revolution.

“How can he who deceived the people in the name of their billion tree afforestation project possibly be the leader of the nation?” asked Shehbaz. He also said that the PML-N would usher a revolution of development and prosperity in KP and a mass transit system like the metro bus would be introduced in Peshawar as well as other major cities.

“A revolution will be brought in the health as well as education sectors to facilitate the people,” he said.

Engineer Amir Muqam appreciated the development vision of Shehbaz, and said that worthwhile development had been made in Lahore and other cities of the province."

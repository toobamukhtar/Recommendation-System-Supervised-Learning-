Pakistan in its checkered political history since 1970 has held ten national elections. But 2018 is unique in many respects.\n\nSerious doubts have been expressed about the fairness of these elections. Except for the PTI (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf) questions have been raised at the ability of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and the caretaker governments at the federal level and in the provinces to provide a level playing field to all the parties.\n\nMechanically speaking on polling day voters are expected to have the freedom to exercise their franchise freely. But voters have already been presented with a fait accompli of sorts. The real rub is in fairness of the whole process that started many months ago to break the back of the PML-N, especially in its stronghold Punjab.\n\nNot only the erstwhile ruling party, the PPP and some other political parties have complained of the not so hidden hand exerting maximum pressure on \u2018electable\u2019 candidates of these parties to switch their loyalties to the PTI. The sleuths have played their cards by cajoling, browbeating or even threatening candidates to switch their loyalties, albeit with mixed results.\n\nThe PML-N by default or by design (perhaps both) has been at the receiving end of the stick. It\u2019s main vote catcher three times prime minister Nawaz Sharif is now incarcerated serving a 10 year jail sentence along with his daughter and heir apparent for seven years, both convicted on charges of corruption.\n\nNot that he is squeaky clean, but the unholy haste shown to put Sharif away just before the elections date smacks of political vendetta according to critics. The ubiquitous establishment answering charges of meddling in the process blandly claims that it has nothing to do with (managing the) elections. But those in the PML-N-and the PPP to a lesser extent claim that they have been consistently arm-twisted by middle to lower level sleuths.\n\nPlans were slightly upset when contrary to expectations that Sharif on the pretext of tending to his ailing wife in London will not return to serve his jail sentence. But he surprised many by heading to Lahore along with his daughter.\n\nThe caretakers and the security agencies were constrained to put the city under siege. Mobile telephone services were suspended and the Rangers blocked major arteries by placing scores of containers on that fateful Friday.\n\nThe main purpose to block Sharif\u2019s possible interaction with his supporters was achieved when as soon as he arrived he was successfully whisked away to Adiala Jail near Rawalpindi. But the whole operation further damaged the credibility of the upcoming elections.\n\nAnother collateral damage has been the credibility and impartiality (or rather lack of it) of the caretaker provincial government in Punjab. Headed by a respected former academic the chief minster and his cabinet never rose above their personal biases against the PML-N and in favour of the PTI.\n\nNot that he is squeaky clean, but the unholy haste shown to put Sharif away just before the elections date smacks of political vendetta according to critics\n\nSome of the cabinet members of the Punjab caretaker setup are in fact cardholder members of the PTI. In the meanwhile scores of PML-N workers are being held either without any charges or on spurious grounds. Those who had assumed the days of preventive detentions harking back to military rules are in a state of shock.\n\nNo stone is being left unturned to ensure victory of the King\u2019s party at the hustings. But yet there are apprehensions in some quarters that the PML-N despite the odds heavily stacked against it might just bag enough seats to remain a major player.\n\nPerhaps the PML-N president Shahbaz Sharif is reading too much into the lackluster crowds at the Khan\u2019s recent election meetings. But the PTI chief is rightly hopeful that he will be able to sweep the elections and form a government on his own strength in the parliament. This is quite possible but not without some favourable tailwind from the powers that be.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is a hung parliament. But many a time the war gamers have been proved wrong in the past. In the 1970 elections it was not being anticipated that Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto with his newly formed rag tag PPP would sweep in West Pakistan and Sheikh Mujeeb Ur Rehman in East Pakistan.\n\nMore recently general Musharraf in the 2002 elections carved out PML-Q from the leaderless PML-N and the Patriots from the PPP. Despite the intensely overt engineering the King\u2019s party could barely scrape through to form a government.\n\nIn the present scenario despite concerted efforts to break the back of the PML-N it is largely intact. In Baluchistan the overnight emergence of BAP (Baluchistan Awami Party) earlier in the year was a new phenomenon without which the PML-N could not have been deprived of a majority in the Senate, thus enabling it to amend the constitution to its own advantages.\n\nSimilarly the now defunct Janoobi Punjab Sooba Mahaz (South Punjab Province Front) comprised of turncoats will go the way the wind blows, just like a weathercock.\n\nAnother interesting development to watch is how some of the jehadists and sectarian outfits fare in the elections. Of course some of these proscribed organizations were overnight dry cleaned to participate in the elections. Perhaps their assigned role is to play the ubiquitous spoiler.\n\nIn the past such infantile strategies have boomeranged. The Taliban and the MQM were created as a result of this very mindset.\n\nPML\u2013N senators including Pervez Rashid and Mushahid Hussain Syed have demanded that the election commission of Pakistan (ECP) and the caretaker government address their concerns about fairness of the election process urgently. Perhaps it is too late in the day for the PML-N senators to complain, as the die has already been cast.\n\nThose who had assumed the days of preventive detentions harking back to military rules are in a state of shock\n\nIn the Islamic Republic, this is an age of Orwellian doublespeak. Everything including the elections is ostensibly being conducted to strengthen democracy. But the real \u2013 albeit unstated \u2013 purpose is to achieve just the opposite.\n\nGeorge Orwell in his eerily futuristic novel Nineteen Eighty-Four about the powers of a totalitarian state never used the word \u201cdouble speak\u201d. Nonetheless doublespeak came to be known as: a language that deliberately obscures disguises or reverses the meaning of words.\n\nSurely elections 2018 just might prove to be the ultimate Orwellian elections.","6":"Social media platform Facebook in collaboration with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is helping over 33 million voters, who are users, in Pakistan identify their constituencies and make sure their votes are registered.\n\nPakistani users receive a pop up in their news feed when they log onto the social media platform which reads, \u201cAre you registered to vote?

The total registered voters are 1,146,665 including 615,708 male and 530,957 female voters.\n\nNA-55 Attock-II\n\nIn NA-55 of Attock district, the actual race is among three candidates out of many. The candidate of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) is a famous politician Major (r) Tahir Saddiq, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz\u2019s (PML-N) candidate is Sheikh Aftab, and Zulfiqar Hayat is of Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP).\n\nAt present, election campaigns of all three candidates are in full swings in the area. Although seasoned politician Sheikh Aftab of PML-N is considered to be a strong candidate to win NA-55, however, Major Sadiq has been giving the PML-N candidate a tough time with his strong election campaign. It is likely that Major Sadiq may win the constituency with a handsome margin as important families, groups, and panels have joined the \u2018Major Group\u2019.\n\nNA-56 Attock-II\n\nA strong fight is expected among five candidates who are Major Sadiq of PTI, Malik Sohail of PML-N, Pir Faisal Shahzad of Tehreek Labaik Ya Rasool Allah (TLY), Sardar Saleem Haider of PPP and independent candidate Malik Shaharyar Khan.\n\nEach candidate is running his campaign with zeal, zest and the confidence that he will win with a majority of voters. However, a surprising result in favour of PPP candidate Sardar Saleem Haider is largely anticipated, especially after the PPP co-chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari\u2019s recent visit in the area in addition to, door to door campaigning.\n\nMajor Sadiq is popular among the public and is a strong candidate but he is participating from two constituencies and one provincial assembly seat that are NA-55 and NA-56. It is said that he will win one NA seat and one provincial assembly seat from the district.\n\nAnother strong candidate is Malik Sohail from PML-N. Malik had earlier joined PTI but left the party due to some differences with Major Sadiq.\n\nMalik Shahryar Khan is an independent candidate launched by famous \u2018Khonda Group\u2019 of the district after he was refused a ticket by PML-N. The Khonda family is the owner of 84 villages of the district, while \u2018Khonda Group\u2019 has a handsome vote bank in the entire district. Malik Shaharyar Khan is the son of former MNA and head of \u2018Khonda Group\u2019 Malik Allah Yar Khan.\n\nPP-I Attock\n\nSix candidates are contesting from PP-I and a tough competition is expected here. A tough competition is likely particularly between PTI\u2019s Yawar Bokhari and an independent candidate Malik Hameed Akbar. Other candidates include Sheikh Salman Sarwar of PML-N and Malik Iqbal of MMA who are also in the run but the neck to neck competition will be between Bokhari and Malik Hameed.\n\nPP-II Attock\n\nDespite the participation of several candidates, a tough competition is likely among four candidates who are Qazi Ahmed Akbar of PTI, Jahangir Khanzada of PML-N, Ahmed Taj Khanzada of PPP and Changez Khan of MMA.\n\nIt is relevant to mention that so far, Khan and Taj Khanzada have gained a strong position during the election campaign. Changez Khan is said to be the right-hand man of Major Sadiq and it is estimated that he will give a tough time in the polls.\n\nAlso, Taj Khanzda being the son of the Khanzada family chief Taj Khanzada and contesting for the very first time on a PPP party ticket is in a strong position.\n\nPP-III Attock\n\nThere is strong competition among three candidates of PP-III. These candidates include Major Sadiq, Haji Riaz Balrah of PPP and Advocate Asif Ali Malik who is a relative of Chaudry Nisar Ali Khan. So far, Major Sadiq has gained a strong position in the area and it is likely that he will win the provincial assembly seat from here.\n\nMoreover, this is Major Sadiq\u2019s native constituency.\n\nPP-IV Attock\n\nA healthy competition among four candidates is expected in PP-4 of Attock district. PPP has given party ticket to an old party worker Haji Akhtar to contest the election, while Chaudry Sher Ali, farmer provincial minister is ticket holder of PML-N, and Col. retd. Anwar is from PTI and Amanat Rawal has party ticket of TLY to give tough time to other competitors in the polls. At present, the position of TLY candidate, who is said very close to Major retd Tahir Saddiq, is strong. However, if Chaudry Sher Ali of PML-N succeeds in convincing angry groups and families who were with him in elections 2013 and senior leadership of PML-N pay visit in the area then he can win the seat but with a close margin.\n\nPP-V Attock\n\nThough there is a competition to win PP-5 seat among the candidates, actual competition on 5th July 2018 is expected among an independent candidate, PML-N candidate and PTI\u2019s candidate. PML-N has awarded ticket to Sardar Bahadur and Jamshaid Altaf has PTI\u2019s ticket while Pir Abbas Mohiuddin is participating in the election as independent candidate. All the candidates are currently engaged to acquire consent\/approval of major groups and biradaries. So far, an independent candidate has gained major success in getting the approval of main groups\/panels and biradaries of this constituency.\n\nIndependent candidate Pir Abbas Mohiuddin is giving a tough time to his rivals and there are greater chances of his success in next elections. Pir Abbas Mohiuddin is the son of farmer parliamentarian Pir Safiuddin who is a close relative of former prime minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani and the top man\/\u2019Gaddi Nasheen\u2019 of the shrine of Makhad Sharif.\n\nPPP candidate for NA-56 Sardar Saleem Haider is fully supporting the independent candidate and in return getting the vote bank of Pir Abbas Mohiuddin.\n\nIt is important to note here that wrong party ticket distribution by PTI might result in losing the PP-5 seat as party ticket holder Jamshaid Altaf belongs to Hassan Abdal and has no deep roots, linkages or vote bank in the area.","8":"Says his \u2018warm\u2019 welcome in Lyari did not go down well with opponents\n\nTHATTA: Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari Monday said that after coming into power, his party would provide food cards to the masses.\n\nBilawal was speaking to his supporters in Gharo city of Thatta district while campaigning for the forthcoming elections.

Moreover, no plans for any public meetings had been decided.\n\nFormer PML-N MNA Malik Shakil Awan said electioneering was limited to door-to-door and street campaigning, and an election office would be established by the National Assembly candidate soon.\n\nFormer PTI MPA Arif Abbasi also admitted to a lack of momentum in the party\u2019s campaigning because of a lack of interest on the part of candidates and workers.\n\nDuring the 2013 elections, campaigning began two months earlier, with the inauguration of the PTI\u2019s central office by Chairman Imran Khan. This time, however, the party was not interested in the work needed to establish a central office that will coordinate with all seven National Assembly constituencies in the district.","10":"LAHORE: Tehreek-e-Labaik Ya Rasool Allah (TLYR) leader Maulana Ashraf Asif Jalali\u2019s nomination papers were rejected on Wednesday by the Lahore High Court appellate tribunal and he was declared ineligible to contest in the upcoming general elections.\n\nAccording to a local media report, the decision was made in accordance with article 62 and 63 of the Constitution during the hearing of an appeal against the approval of Jalali\u2019s nomination papers for NA-81 Gujranwala constituency.\n\nMoreover, the tribunal termed the returning officer\u2019s decision as null and void.

These fundamental changes in political communication, therefore, present election candidates with a wide range of strategic choices.\n\nThe political parties earlier invested heavily in electronic and print media during election campaigns to get due coverage of their political activities, however, they can now convey their messages to the public to a greater extent, within no time, through social media with little investment.\n\nSo keeping in view the importance of social media, sources told Pakistan Today that various mainstream political parties have hired services of social media professionals and volunteers in order to reach out to the maximum number of people for the forthcoming general elections.\n\nThough the political parties have yet to start formal electioneering because they have not finalised the process of distribution of tickets, their respective social media teams have already started vigorous campaigning on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nAll major political leaders especially Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan, Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Maryam Nawaz are the regular users of Twitter and have a great following.\n\nHowever, PTI Chairman Imran Khan is the most popular leader on micro-blogging website Twitter in Pakistan with his followers reaching 8.03 million.

This has led to the rejection of the papers of some of the leading contestants that include former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and PTI chief Imran Khan from NA-53 Islamabad. It was maintained that Abbasi had not submitted complete tax returns with his documents. It is difficult to believe that a man who has been elected six times to the National Assembly would submit incomplete documents. Imran Khan\u2019s papers were rejected for failing to fill a column in the affidavit in which he was required to describe his performance as an MNA. This is surprising as papers of several legislators who never spoke a single word in the NA sittings have been accepted. Interestingly Khan\u2019s nomination papers were validated by the ROs for NA-35 Bannu, NA-243 Karachi and NA-131 Lahore. There was a need for the ROs to be following a uniform policy in all constituencies. One hopes the Appellate Tribunals would undo the injustice.\n\nA perception is fast growing that a particular party is being treated as more equal than others. The way a telephone call from Imran Khan led the interior secretary to remove the name of Zulfi Bukhari from the black list temporarily without even consulting NADRA has sent a message to the accountability body and bureaucracy that the PTI is to be treated as a favourite. The promise to reshuffle bureaucracy also follows a demand made by the PTI. The first woman to hold Punjab AGP office was removed from post because she was not acceptable to PTI. This has led LHBA to condemn the arbitrary removal calling it an \u201cabuse of discretion and a blatant violation of due process\u201d. Despite all these factors favourable to it the PTI remains perturbed over the outcome of the elections. The party is presumably upset over its failure to generate a popularity wave among the electorate.","15":"KARACHI: Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) Chairman Mustafa Kamal on Wednesday predicted a clean sweep for his party in Karachi from Sindh and a surprise showing in Balochistan for the 2018 general election.\n\n\u201cIn Karachi, our competition on 2-3 seats is with the Pakistan Peoples Party.

Pakistan in its checkered political history since 1970 has held ten national elections. But 2018 is unique in many respects.\n\nSerious doubts have been expressed about the fairness of these elections. Except for the PTI (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf) questions have been raised at the ability of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and the caretaker governments at the federal level and in the provinces to provide a level playing field to all the parties.\n\nMechanically speaking on polling day voters are expected to have the freedom to exercise their franchise freely. But voters have already been presented with a fait accompli of sorts. The real rub is in fairness of the whole process that started many months ago to break the back of the PML-N, especially in its stronghold Punjab.\n\nNot only the erstwhile ruling party, the PPP and some other political parties have complained of the not so hidden hand exerting maximum pressure on \u2018electable\u2019 candidates of these parties to switch their loyalties to the PTI. The sleuths have played their cards by cajoling, browbeating or even threatening candidates to switch their loyalties, albeit with mixed results.\n\nThe PML-N by default or by design (perhaps both) has been at the receiving end of the stick. It\u2019s main vote catcher three times prime minister Nawaz Sharif is now incarcerated serving a 10 year jail sentence along with his daughter and heir apparent for seven years, both convicted on charges of corruption.\n\nNot that he is squeaky clean, but the unholy haste shown to put Sharif away just before the elections date smacks of political vendetta according to critics. The ubiquitous establishment answering charges of meddling in the process blandly claims that it has nothing to do with (managing the) elections. But those in the PML-N-and the PPP to a lesser extent claim that they have been consistently arm-twisted by middle to lower level sleuths.\n\nPlans were slightly upset when contrary to expectations that Sharif on the pretext of tending to his ailing wife in London will not return to serve his jail sentence. But he surprised many by heading to Lahore along with his daughter.\n\nThe caretakers and the security agencies were constrained to put the city under siege. Mobile telephone services were suspended and the Rangers blocked major arteries by placing scores of containers on that fateful Friday.\n\nThe main purpose to block Sharif\u2019s possible interaction with his supporters was achieved when as soon as he arrived he was successfully whisked away to Adiala Jail near Rawalpindi. But the whole operation further damaged the credibility of the upcoming elections.\n\nAnother collateral damage has been the credibility and impartiality (or rather lack of it) of the caretaker provincial government in Punjab. Headed by a respected former academic the chief minster and his cabinet never rose above their personal biases against the PML-N and in favour of the PTI.\n\nNot that he is squeaky clean, but the unholy haste shown to put Sharif away just before the elections date smacks of political vendetta according to critics\n\nSome of the cabinet members of the Punjab caretaker setup are in fact cardholder members of the PTI. In the meanwhile scores of PML-N workers are being held either without any charges or on spurious grounds. Those who had assumed the days of preventive detentions harking back to military rules are in a state of shock.\n\nNo stone is being left unturned to ensure victory of the King\u2019s party at the hustings. But yet there are apprehensions in some quarters that the PML-N despite the odds heavily stacked against it might just bag enough seats to remain a major player.\n\nPerhaps the PML-N president Shahbaz Sharif is reading too much into the lackluster crowds at the Khan\u2019s recent election meetings. But the PTI chief is rightly hopeful that he will be able to sweep the elections and form a government on his own strength in the parliament. This is quite possible but not without some favourable tailwind from the powers that be.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is a hung parliament. But many a time the war gamers have been proved wrong in the past. In the 1970 elections it was not being anticipated that Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto with his newly formed rag tag PPP would sweep in West Pakistan and Sheikh Mujeeb Ur Rehman in East Pakistan.\n\nMore recently general Musharraf in the 2002 elections carved out PML-Q from the leaderless PML-N and the Patriots from the PPP. Despite the intensely overt engineering the King\u2019s party could barely scrape through to form a government.\n\nIn the present scenario despite concerted efforts to break the back of the PML-N it is largely intact. In Baluchistan the overnight emergence of BAP (Baluchistan Awami Party) earlier in the year was a new phenomenon without which the PML-N could not have been deprived of a majority in the Senate, thus enabling it to amend the constitution to its own advantages.\n\nSimilarly the now defunct Janoobi Punjab Sooba Mahaz (South Punjab Province Front) comprised of turncoats will go the way the wind blows, just like a weathercock.\n\nAnother interesting development to watch is how some of the jehadists and sectarian outfits fare in the elections. Of course some of these proscribed organizations were overnight dry cleaned to participate in the elections. Perhaps their assigned role is to play the ubiquitous spoiler.\n\nIn the past such infantile strategies have boomeranged. The Taliban and the MQM were created as a result of this very mindset.\n\nPML\u2013N senators including Pervez Rashid and Mushahid Hussain Syed have demanded that the election commission of Pakistan (ECP) and the caretaker government address their concerns about fairness of the election process urgently. Perhaps it is too late in the day for the PML-N senators to complain, as the die has already been cast.\n\nThose who had assumed the days of preventive detentions harking back to military rules are in a state of shock\n\nIn the Islamic Republic, this is an age of Orwellian doublespeak. Everything including the elections is ostensibly being conducted to strengthen democracy. But the real \u2013 albeit unstated \u2013 purpose is to achieve just the opposite.\n\nGeorge Orwell in his eerily futuristic novel Nineteen Eighty-Four about the powers of a totalitarian state never used the word \u201cdouble speak\u201d. Nonetheless doublespeak came to be known as: a language that deliberately obscures disguises or reverses the meaning of words.\n\nSurely elections 2018 just might prove to be the ultimate Orwellian elections.","23":"Social media platform Facebook in collaboration with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is helping over 33 million voters, who are users, in Pakistan identify their constituencies and make sure their votes are registered.\n\nPakistani users receive a pop up in their news feed when they log onto the social media platform which reads, \u201cAre you registered to vote?

The total registered voters are 1,146,665 including 615,708 male and 530,957 female voters.\n\nNA-55 Attock-II\n\nIn NA-55 of Attock district, the actual race is among three candidates out of many. The candidate of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) is a famous politician Major (r) Tahir Saddiq, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz\u2019s (PML-N) candidate is Sheikh Aftab, and Zulfiqar Hayat is of Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP).\n\nAt present, election campaigns of all three candidates are in full swings in the area. Although seasoned politician Sheikh Aftab of PML-N is considered to be a strong candidate to win NA-55, however, Major Sadiq has been giving the PML-N candidate a tough time with his strong election campaign. It is likely that Major Sadiq may win the constituency with a handsome margin as important families, groups, and panels have joined the \u2018Major Group\u2019.\n\nNA-56 Attock-II\n\nA strong fight is expected among five candidates who are Major Sadiq of PTI, Malik Sohail of PML-N, Pir Faisal Shahzad of Tehreek Labaik Ya Rasool Allah (TLY), Sardar Saleem Haider of PPP and independent candidate Malik Shaharyar Khan.\n\nEach candidate is running his campaign with zeal, zest and the confidence that he will win with a majority of voters. However, a surprising result in favour of PPP candidate Sardar Saleem Haider is largely anticipated, especially after the PPP co-chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari\u2019s recent visit in the area in addition to, door to door campaigning.\n\nMajor Sadiq is popular among the public and is a strong candidate but he is participating from two constituencies and one provincial assembly seat that are NA-55 and NA-56. It is said that he will win one NA seat and one provincial assembly seat from the district.\n\nAnother strong candidate is Malik Sohail from PML-N. Malik had earlier joined PTI but left the party due to some differences with Major Sadiq.\n\nMalik Shahryar Khan is an independent candidate launched by famous \u2018Khonda Group\u2019 of the district after he was refused a ticket by PML-N. The Khonda family is the owner of 84 villages of the district, while \u2018Khonda Group\u2019 has a handsome vote bank in the entire district. Malik Shaharyar Khan is the son of former MNA and head of \u2018Khonda Group\u2019 Malik Allah Yar Khan.\n\nPP-I Attock\n\nSix candidates are contesting from PP-I and a tough competition is expected here. A tough competition is likely particularly between PTI\u2019s Yawar Bokhari and an independent candidate Malik Hameed Akbar. Other candidates include Sheikh Salman Sarwar of PML-N and Malik Iqbal of MMA who are also in the run but the neck to neck competition will be between Bokhari and Malik Hameed.\n\nPP-II Attock\n\nDespite the participation of several candidates, a tough competition is likely among four candidates who are Qazi Ahmed Akbar of PTI, Jahangir Khanzada of PML-N, Ahmed Taj Khanzada of PPP and Changez Khan of MMA.\n\nIt is relevant to mention that so far, Khan and Taj Khanzada have gained a strong position during the election campaign. Changez Khan is said to be the right-hand man of Major Sadiq and it is estimated that he will give a tough time in the polls.\n\nAlso, Taj Khanzda being the son of the Khanzada family chief Taj Khanzada and contesting for the very first time on a PPP party ticket is in a strong position.\n\nPP-III Attock\n\nThere is strong competition among three candidates of PP-III. These candidates include Major Sadiq, Haji Riaz Balrah of PPP and Advocate Asif Ali Malik who is a relative of Chaudry Nisar Ali Khan. So far, Major Sadiq has gained a strong position in the area and it is likely that he will win the provincial assembly seat from here.\n\nMoreover, this is Major Sadiq\u2019s native constituency.\n\nPP-IV Attock\n\nA healthy competition among four candidates is expected in PP-4 of Attock district. PPP has given party ticket to an old party worker Haji Akhtar to contest the election, while Chaudry Sher Ali, farmer provincial minister is ticket holder of PML-N, and Col. retd. Anwar is from PTI and Amanat Rawal has party ticket of TLY to give tough time to other competitors in the polls. At present, the position of TLY candidate, who is said very close to Major retd Tahir Saddiq, is strong. However, if Chaudry Sher Ali of PML-N succeeds in convincing angry groups and families who were with him in elections 2013 and senior leadership of PML-N pay visit in the area then he can win the seat but with a close margin.\n\nPP-V Attock\n\nThough there is a competition to win PP-5 seat among the candidates, actual competition on 5th July 2018 is expected among an independent candidate, PML-N candidate and PTI\u2019s candidate. PML-N has awarded ticket to Sardar Bahadur and Jamshaid Altaf has PTI\u2019s ticket while Pir Abbas Mohiuddin is participating in the election as independent candidate. All the candidates are currently engaged to acquire consent\/approval of major groups and biradaries.

Moreover, no plans for any public meetings had been decided.\n\nFormer PML-N MNA Malik Shakil Awan said electioneering was limited to door-to-door and street campaigning, and an election office would be established by the National Assembly candidate soon.\n\nFormer PTI MPA Arif Abbasi also admitted to a lack of momentum in the party\u2019s campaigning because of a lack of interest on the part of candidates and workers.\n\nDuring the 2013 elections, campaigning began two months earlier, with the inauguration of the PTI\u2019s central office by Chairman Imran Khan. This time, however, the party was not interested in the work needed to establish a central office that will coordinate with all seven National Assembly constituencies in the district.","27":"LAHORE: Tehreek-e-Labaik Ya Rasool Allah (TLYR) leader Maulana Ashraf Asif Jalali\u2019s nomination papers were rejected on Wednesday by the Lahore High Court appellate tribunal and he was declared ineligible to contest in the upcoming general elections.\n\nAccording to a local media report, the decision was made in accordance with article 62 and 63 of the Constitution during the hearing of an appeal against the approval of Jalali\u2019s nomination papers for NA-81 Gujranwala constituency.\n\nMoreover, the tribunal termed the returning officer\u2019s decision as null and void. At the same time, it allowed former state minister Saira Afzal Tarar to contest the upcoming general election.\n\nA voter from NA-87 (Hafizabad) had filed an appeal against the decision of the returning officer saying Tarar concealed details of her properties in nomination papers. However, the tribunal dismissed the appeal and upheld the decision of the returning officer.\n\nPML-N\u2019s covering candidate from NA-81 (Gujranwala), Atif Farid Sabir challenged the nomination papers of Maulana Jalali accusing him of not disclosing information about his income tax return.\n\nHe said Jalali had also failed to submit his passport to the returning officer despite an order issued by the Supreme Court. He said the returning officer had ignored the facts and accepted nomination papers of Jalali.\n\nThe tribunal accepted the appeal and set aside the decision of the returning officer disqualifying Maulana Jalali to contest the polls.","28":"ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Wednesday issued the code of conduct and guidelines for local media for the coverage of the upcoming polls.\n\nAccording to the code of conduct, it the media\u2019s responsibility to provide citizens with the correct information.

These fundamental changes in political communication, therefore, present election candidates with a wide range of strategic choices.\n\nThe political parties earlier invested heavily in electronic and print media during election campaigns to get due coverage of their political activities, however, they can now convey their messages to the public to a greater extent, within no time, through social media with little investment.\n\nSo keeping in view the importance of social media, sources told Pakistan Today that various mainstream political parties have hired services of social media professionals and volunteers in order to reach out to the maximum number of people for the forthcoming general elections.\n\nThough the political parties have yet to start formal electioneering because they have not finalised the process of distribution of tickets, their respective social media teams have already started vigorous campaigning on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nAll major political leaders especially Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan, Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Maryam Nawaz are the regular users of Twitter and have a great following.\n\nHowever, PTI Chairman Imran Khan is the most popular leader on micro-blogging website Twitter in Pakistan with his followers reaching 8.03 million.

This time again the ROs seem to have been provided no uniform standard to examine the nomination papers. This has led to the rejection of the papers of some of the leading contestants that include former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and PTI chief Imran Khan from NA-53 Islamabad. It was maintained that Abbasi had not submitted complete tax returns with his documents. It is difficult to believe that a man who has been elected six times to the National Assembly would submit incomplete documents. Imran Khan\u2019s papers were rejected for failing to fill a column in the affidavit in which he was required to describe his performance as an MNA. This is surprising as papers of several legislators who never spoke a single word in the NA sittings have been accepted. Interestingly Khan\u2019s nomination papers were validated by the ROs for NA-35 Bannu, NA-243 Karachi and NA-131 Lahore. There was a need for the ROs to be following a uniform policy in all constituencies. One hopes the Appellate Tribunals would undo the injustice.\n\nA perception is fast growing that a particular party is being treated as more equal than others. The way a telephone call from Imran Khan led the interior secretary to remove the name of Zulfi Bukhari from the black list temporarily without even consulting NADRA has sent a message to the accountability body and bureaucracy that the PTI is to be treated as a favourite. The promise to reshuffle bureaucracy also follows a demand made by the PTI. The first woman to hold Punjab AGP office was removed from post because she was not acceptable to PTI. This has led LHBA to condemn the arbitrary removal calling it an \u201cabuse of discretion and a blatant violation of due process\u201d. Despite all these factors favourable to it the PTI remains perturbed over the outcome of the elections. The party is presumably upset over its failure to generate a popularity wave among the electorate.","32":"KARACHI: Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) Chairman Mustafa Kamal on Wednesday predicted a clean sweep for his party in Karachi from Sindh and a surprise showing in Balochistan for the 2018 general election.\n\n\u201cIn Karachi, our competition on 2-3 seats is with the Pakistan Peoples Party.

In the current situation, Tariq Fazal Chaudhary has surfaced as the strongest contender to contest from two seats of the capital namely NA-52 and NA-53. While former MNA Anjum Aqeel Khan is a strong contender for a ticket against Asad Umer of PTI in NA-54 and Mian Aslam of Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) for NA-52 and NA-53.\n\nThe rural urban divide played in PML-N\u2019s favour during the last general elections, as well as, local bodies elections. It is yet to be seen how the new delimitation will affect this paradigm.\n\nWith banners placed few and far between roads and pavements, lone hoardings and half hearted meetings between candidates being the current atmosphere, it is expected that the federal capital will be gripped by election fever immediately after Eid. As per the data from returning officers, 172 individuals have received forms from three constituencies of Islamabad and more candidates are expected to submit their forms by the deadline on June 11.\n\n\u201cWith Imran Khan contesting the elections from NA-54, we will execute his campaign 24\/7.

The decision by the ECP cannot be challenged in any court. Earlier in March, both the CJP and COAS had been quoted that if the delimitation wasn\u2019t finished on time this might lead to the postponement of elections. The ECP had however assured that it would complete the task well within time, a pledge it has redeemed.\n\nAs it is common in Pakistan for the rumour mill to start grinding conspiracy theories, statements attributing motives behind a possible postponement of elections came both from the legal community and politicians. A Pakistan Bar Council executive member expressed fears that the judiciary might be used to postpone elections. He wrote a letter to all 22 representatives of the legal fraternity\u2019s apex body, calling upon them to pass a strong resolution to resist any move to postpone the upcoming elections. Javed Hashmi\u2019s fertile imagination brought forth another doomsday scenario. He maintained that a caretaker government would be formed without consultation with the prime minister and leader of the opposition and the SC with the caretaker set up would postpone the elections for an indefinite period.\n\nA perception is being formed that both Zardari and Imran Khan are dissatisfied about their electoral prospects. Zardari has suggested that dire necessity might lead the two to join hands against the PML-N after the elections. Postponement of the elections could be another way out. Two weeks back Sheikh Rashid predicted that the elections would be postponed \u201ckeeping in view the ongoing political climate of the country\u201d and would be delayed to September or October. In his latest TV interview Imran Khan predicted the elections could be deferred by 30-45 days.\n\nBoth the SC and the ECP have promised to hold free, fair and timely elections. PM Abbasi\u2019s lame duck government cannot effectively deal with the internal and external challenges faced by Pakistan. The IMF has underlined the problems the country could face if political uncertainty was to be prolonged. This requires elections to be held on schedule and an orderly handing over of power to the next elected set up.","42":"Shaky government on the cards\n\nAlthough Pakistan\u2019s Parliament completes its term in June 2018, the fresh consensus list at best can be used provisionally. In 2017, Pakistan\u2019s parliament had passed The Elections Act 2017. To be in line with international standards, the Act places a limit on constitution variation not to exceed 10pc. For this consensus data needs to be officially published. This is the basic requirement to conduct fresh delimitation. Since there is no such publication, the political parties passed a Constitutional Amendment allowing ECP to use the provisional results. Using this and the Election Rules 2017 duly issued by ECP delimitation process have been underway since beginning of 2018.\n\nPutting aside this technical hurdle that has to be overcome a number of other issues too looms large on the horizon.\n\nPolitical alignments are undergoing a huge shift. No party seems to have an ideological stance and with PML-N\u2019s legislators defecting, things do not look good for the ruling party. Many \u2018electables\u2019 have already ditched PML-N. Most have joined PTI. However, their departure from PML-N ranks for greener pastures is something one often sees with fresh elections looming. Many in PML-N joined the party post 2013 elections and many were earlier members of PML-Q. PML-N had opened its door for all shades of turncoats and now is being paid back in the same coin.\n\nThen there are the independent candidates emerging as victors who can be used to render support to a party. That the party may not be PML-N is a foregone conclusion. The decision of Supreme Court ousting Nawaz Sharif as prime minister and subsequent cases being conducted by NAB are not a good omen for the party.\n\nProvincial, regional, religious and ethnic colours have made the canvas murky. An example was the by-elections of NA 120. Ending up third was the Labbaik Party bagging 7,180 votes, followed by Milli Muslim League with 5,822 votes. Hussain Rizvi, candidate of Labbaik Ya Rasul Allah, managed to scoop 6pc of the votes cast. He campaigned in favour of stringent blasphemy laws. His posters claimed love and admiration of Mumtaz Qadri who killed the then Punjab Governor Salman Taseer. Upon this act, many religious factions declared Qadri a hero. Yaqoob Sheikh winning from Milli Muslim League platform; in 2012 was titled a terrorist by US managed to capture 5pc votes. MML is the political springboard of Hafiz Saeed\u2019s JuD. Mosques were a favourite place of promoting their candidates by these Islamic based parties. Should these parties be made to renounce terrorism and violence in all forms, denounce militancy and de-weaponise and then be allowed to enter mainstream politics?\n\nWith Khawaja Asif\u2019s disqualification for life for holding an Iqama by High Court (IHC) comes a big blow to PML-N and will likely have a negative cascading impact on PML-N leading to more legislators jumping the ship\n\nOn face of it \u2014 it seems the Parliament will be a hung one. Punjab is stronghold of PML-N. Six MNAs and two MPAs have already left PML-N from Rahim Yar Khan, Bahawal Nagar, Faisalabad, Gujranwala to name a few with the purpose of pursuing the demarcation for South Punjab thereby creating a new province.\n\nWith Khawaja Asif\u2019s disqualification for life for holding an Iqama by High Court (IHC) comes a big blow to PML-N and will likely have a negative cascading impact on PML-N leading to more legislators jumping the ship.\n\nIt does not seem likely that PML-N will win parliamentary majority. It also does not seem likely that he will be able to garner support of other parties to win that majority. The odds are against it.\n\nSo what will happen?\n\nCan PTI garner enough support with the help of extreme rightists, a mix of independents and cobbling together a mix of smaller groups to form a government? Will this group on issues be on the same page or lead to more chaos? How long will it survive? A broth made by too many cooks is bound to spoil.\n\nHow different parties manage the voters on Election Day is important as is galvanising supporters to come out to vote.\n\nPPP has reduced itself to a sub-provincial party restricted to rural Sindh. If elections of NA-120 is anything to go by, PPP has very little standing outside of their niche. A most disturbing aspect of NA 120 elections had been the demise of PPP. This was the constituency which largely came under NW-60 in 1970 won by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto by 78,000 votes. His main contestant was Dr Javed Iqbal, son of Allama Iqbal. In 2017, PPP bagged only 1,404 votes. It ended up last in the race. A sad state for a party that had won the hearts and minds of people under the dynamic leadership of Bhutto.\n\nThe question is which of these weak parties manage to get the magical figure of 172 numbers and who will form the 172? Achievement of this goal is one thing, running a government successfully of a motley group of divergent thought processes thrown together is quite another.\n\nIt will be a system chaos.\n\nEnd Note: \u201cGood governance never depends upon laws, but upon the personal qualities of those who govern. The machinery of government is always subordinate to the will of those who administer that machinery. The most important element of government, therefore, is the method of choosing leaders.\u201d\n\n\u2015 Frank Herbert, Children of Dune","43":"ECP fixes April 24 as deadline for reviewing electoral rolls\n\nFor the upcoming general elections, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has decided to use watermarked ballot papers, for which the paper would be purchased from France, reported a local media outlet on Sunday.\n\nAccording to reports, the special paper will be provided in June 2018 after which the printing process will start.\n\nSources said that the ECP has paid an advance amount for the purchase, with the printing process costing over Rs610 million. With the total cost of purchasing, the ballot papers will be over Rs1 billion.\n\nThe printing press corporation will be given Rs150 million while the postal printing will be provided Rs110 million.\n\nMeanwhile, the ECP has also fixed April 24 as the deadline for reviewing electoral rolls, whereby entry, transfer and cancellation of votes are allowed until the deadline.

He alleged that members of the ruling party led by Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah stormed the polling booth and that ballot papers were being snuck out after casting empty votes in the ballot boxes.\n\n\u201cElection result should be declared null and void if empty slips are recovered from ballot boxes,\u201d he demanded. The PTI member said he has also registered a protest with the presiding officer.\n\nOn the other hand, another PTI leader Raja Riaz asked for the vote in Senate polls from Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah.\n\nAccording to details, Raja Riaz stopped Rana Sanaullah in Punjab Assembly when he was about to cast the first vote and asked him to give his vote to PTI.\n\nIn a response, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader smiled and left the place after the brief meeting.\n\nWILL BECOME PTI\u2019S FIRST SENATOR FROM PUNJAB: CH SARWAR\n\nPTI leader Chaudhry Mohammad Sarwar said that he will become his party\u2019s first senator from Punjab.\n\nSpeaking to media outside the Punjab Assembly regarding PTI\u2019s Senate election campaign, he stated, \u201cEverything is fair in love and war.

She said that an elected PM was removed on the basis of Iqama. No evidence was found against Nawaz Sharif, she added.\n\nThe minister said that PML-N will emerge as the winner in today\u2019s polls.\n\nASSEMBLIES WILL COMPLETE TERM: KHURSHEED SHAH\n\nOpposition Leader in National Assembly (NA) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) member Khursheed Shah has said that the assemblies will complete their tenure and that the rumours about the postponement of elections will cease to exist after today\u2019s Senate polls.\n\nMeanwhile, PPP\u2019s Sharjeel Memon said that his party has nominated hard working candidates for Senate elections, adding that National Accountability Bureau\u2019s (NAB) law in Punjab is different from other provinces.\n\nHe said that he will not criticize judiciary like ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif and Chief Minister of Punjab (CM) Shehbaz Sharif.\n\nFormer CM Sindh Qaim Ali Shah said democracy ensures freedom of every individual, continuing that the members will cast vote as per their wish.\n\nPML-N, PML-F, MQM-P STRIKE DEAL: ARBAB\n\nPML-N Sindh leader Arbab Ghulam Rahim stated that the ruling party, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and PML-F would be supporting each other in the Senate elections.\n\nTalking to press, the former chief minister claimed that a deal has been struck between the ruling party and the major opposition parties in Sindh.\n\nHe said the ruling party MPAs in Sindh Assembly would be supporting the candidates of PML-F for general seats and MQM-P for technocrat seats of the Senate and that \u201cunwritten pacts\u201d have been made among the opposition parties.\n\nSimilarly, Special Assistant to Prime Minister Dr Musadik Malik stated that masses have a deep affection for Nawaz Sharif and said that PML-N would bag 12 Senate seats from Punjab.\n\nHe said that PML-N believed in serving people and would continue its efforts for bringing prosperity and development in the country.\n\nOn the other hand, MNA Tahir Iqbal from Vehari who was formerly associated with PML-N refused to cast his vote in the Senate elections. He stated that he cannot vote for those who were involved in the finality of the prophethood clause.","46":"A major reshuffle with important implications\n\nSenate elections 2018 will be drawing more attention than any other held so far. The biggest loser would be the PML-N and PPP and the biggest gainer the PTI. What needs to be watched is the extent of their gains and losses.\n\nThe unexpected parliamentary coup in Balochistan has upset PML-N\u2019s plans for the future. The party had hoped that with both the NA and Senate under its control, it would be able to pass laws overriding some of the Supreme Court decisions that have caused the party a grave set back. Further, the PML-N would also be able to fall back on parliament\u2019s support during the tenure of the three consecutive Chief Justices least liked by it who would hold office for most of the time till 2023 elections. The PML-F which, was on the brink of extinction in the Senate with all its four Senators retiring on March 11, is looking up for a new lease of life due to the change of government in Balochistan.\n\nBesides losing 70 percent of its Senators who would retire, the PPP would also be deprived of some of its enlightened and articulate Senators that include Aitzaz Ahsan, Raza Rabbani, Farhatulah Babar and Taj Haider. When the reports of dissension in PML-N\u2019s parliamentary committee in Balochistan became public party leaders in Punjab accused Zardari of pulling the strings but this was denied by the PPP. The meeting between Balochistan cabinet members led by CM Abdul Quddus Bizenjo and PPP leaders led by Zardari in Karachi suggests the rumours were not altogether false. It remains to be seen if the PPP, which has no legislator in Balochistan Assembly, can manage to get PPP Senators elected from the province.\n\nThe PTI which entered the Senate first time in 2015 would now double its seats to 14. Ishaq Dar would be the most prominent among the nine retiring PML-N Sentors. Mushahid Hussain Syed of the PML-F would be another prominent Senator to retire. There is a likelihood of the PML-N getting him re-elected on its ticket.","47":"Politicians should shift from pressure to persuasion mode\n\nWith PPP withholding its reservations on the provisional Census Report, the Senate has finally passed the Delimitation of Constituencies Bill. This removes the only hurdle which could have blocked timely elections. The rumour mills are left with little grist after the COAS made it clear that the army stood by democracy and he considered presidential system unsuitable for the country. Further that the army will carry out decisions taken by the Parliament. Thus the national government is no more than a pipe dream like the much talked about government of technocrats.\n\nThe delimitation of constituencies is reportedly already being conducted by the Election Commission (EC) on the presumption that the bill cleared by the National Assembly was finally going to be approved by the Senate. Consequently the EC will have smooth sailing now. One expects the present EC to put up a better performance than was witnessed in 2013 elections. It should be wiser after receiving inputs from the electoral reforms committee. A judicial Commission which probed complaints about 2013 elections also pointed out a number of weaknesses and shortcomings in the electoral system. The complaints regarding candidates spending huge mounts on campaigns, thus queering the pitch for the middle class contestants, need to be redressed in the upcoming polls. Unless the EC takes a firm stand on lowering election expenses the perception that legislative bodies have turned into millionaires\u2019 clubs would continue to persist taking away much of the sheen from democracy.\n\nIt is presumed that the EC would be ready to hold the elections by the end of July or early August. It is time political parties put an end to protest marches and sit-ins and instead concentrate on preparing well thought out, realistic and forward looking election manifestos. Attempts should be made by the mainstream parties to reach a consensus on long gestation socio-economic policies and outstanding issues like population control so that these continue to be implemented irrespective of which one of them is in power.","48":"The topi drama of NS, AAZ and IK has started to fool voters once more\n\nIn the last few weeks it seems that election campaigns have been started by Nawaz Sharif, Asif Ali Zardari, and Imran Khan to once again start selling dreams that they don\u2019t have the capability or the desire to deliver.\n\nNawaz Sharif is spending the future earnings of the nation on extravagant projects at extravagant costs. He is burdening the future generations with one of the largest debts to pursue his ideas of grandiose.\n\nAsif Ali Zardari sees a heaven in Sind standing at his balcony in Larkana, Anything not done is the fault of the federal government and lack of funds rather than his own government\u2019s fault. Almost 10 years of his party rule is not enough for it. He needs one more term. His government in Sindh can threaten to shut off the gas when his own interests are at stake but his hands are tied when it comes to interests of people of Sindh.\n\nImran Khan keeps telling people that the police force is now independent and free to act. But the police was standing idly by watching the brutal killing of an innocent student in Mardan. Imran Khan has also funded a madrassah with a long history of extremist views and changed the curriculum to accommodate his extreme right allies to remain in government. Not only that, he has allied himself with the same status quo politicians rather than offer new leadership to the nation.\n\nThe politics of cults: All for one \u2013 and one for himself\n\nHere, I am not blaming the parties \u2013 just these individuals. The parties are practically non-existent because the capable members refuse to stand up and prefer to remain loyal to these individuals rather than the ideals or principles of the party as a whole.\n\nRaza Rabbani made a public statement stating that he will not preside over sanctioning of military courts as Chairman of Senate. But he then did precisely that \u2013 although he openly cried when he did it the first time. He had to succumb to the wishes of the party chief rather than the pursuit his ideals. His loyalty seems to be with the party head rather than of the party or the nation.\n\nAitzaz Ahsan kept narrating revolutionary verses but kept quite when he could have pursued corruption of the politicians in the Panama case because his party bosses told him to stay out of it. A similar situation prevails in the family enterprise of PML-N and the cultish culture of PTI.\n\nThis is an unsustainable situation and cannot go on for long if we want to save our country from disintegration. Provinces are not cards that can be exploited for political benefits. Rather, they have real people with have real needs. Capable people in political parties have to rise up and stand for their principles and ideals.\n\nWhen you talk the talk \u2026\n\nAs a member of PTI, I have always tried to stand up for principles even if I had to oppose my own party Chief. So I am not merely making suggestions to activists of other parties. I have walked the walk throughout my association with the party at the cost of being denied party tickets and positions. I have no regret about that and will continue doing it.\n\nPTI can\u2019t win next elections unless it offers a new vision, develops policies that reflect that vision and show the capability to execute it as well when in power. I advise Chairman Imran Khan to create a manifesto committee and I would like to be part of it. It is my responsibility to offer my services and it is the right of Chairman Imran Khan to accept or reject them. But whatever committee is formed should be based on party constitution. I, for one, would not accept any role in an unconstitutional committee.","49":"ISLAMABAD: The Cabinet Division has forwarded a summary to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif seeking allocation of appropriate funds to procure 16 new printing machines as three presses of the country are unable to print 20 crores (200 million) ballot papers for the general elections 2018.\n\nOfficial documents available with Pakistan Today reveal that managers of all three presses, including Printing Corporation of Pakistan (PCP), Pakistan Security Printing Corporation (PSPC) and Pakistan Post Foundation Press (PPF), have expressed inability to print more than 200 million ballot papers during a meeting with Election Commission Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Raza.\n\nThe meeting took place on September 26, 2016, to discuss the arrangements for the printing of ballot papers to be used in upcoming general elections.\n\nThe managers had communicated inability to print required ballot papers due to old and low capacity printing machines.\n\nAccording to present printing capacity of three big presses of the country, the PCP can print only 54mn ballot papers, the PSPC can print 75mn, and the PPF can print 60mn ballot papers (large size ballot) and 90mn (single column ballot) ballot papers by working 20 hours per day in 20 days.\n\nThe documents also disclosed that the Cabinet Division had submitted a summary to the premier for allocation of appropriate funds (Rs864 million) to obtain 16 new two colour printing machines with an automatic numbering facility to increase the printing capacity of PCP to print 153.60 mn ballot papers in 20 days in addition to the existing capacity and resultantly the PCP would be able to print total up to 207.60 mn ballot papers.\n\nGeneral elections-2018 is scheduled to be held anytime in the country within 90 days after June 5, 2018. And, preparations and arrangements made so far in this regard clearly tell that an old method of voting through ballot papers is likely to be adopted in next general elections to dupe the gullible.\n\nInterestingly, after previous general elections held in May 2013, all political parties except ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) blamed that the elections were rigged.\n\nThey all urged the government to bring reforms in the electoral system by introducing modern technologies.\n\nAnd, an introduction of electronic voting machines (EVMs) and biometric verification (BVMs) was part of bringing reforms in the electoral system. However, the government and opposition sides have so far shown a lack of interest regarding bringing reforms in the electoral system of the country.\n\nFurthermore, the inability of three presses of the country to print enough ballot papers calls for the government attention besides, allocation of appropriate funds to procure 16 new printing machines. Also, there is need to introduce electronic voting in those parts of the country where 3 G and 4 G technology is available to make the election a fair, transparent and trustworthy exercise in the country.","50":"Free and Fair Election Network (FAFEN) has revealed its plans for observing electoral processes for the next general election, expected in August 2018, by mobilizing more than 22,000 trained non-partisan citizen observers in all National Assembly constituencies.\n\nAt a gathering of key election stakeholders on Tuesday, FAFEN indicated that it will start observing pre-election processes from April 2018 by mobilizing more than 6,000 citizen observers across the country.

Again, the assessment of the quality of this process shows that while the lowest score assigned to this process was 40% after General Election of 2002, which saw the worst-of-its-kind post-poll rigging in recent history, the score improved after GE 2008 to 56%, recorded significant further improvements with the score of 68% after General Election 2013 and has now recorded a decline even lower than GE 2008. This decline in the quality of Post-election score compared to GE 2013 may partly be attributed to the fact that PMLN had gained a clear majority in the National and Provincial Assembly of Punjab in GE 2013 and it did not need to make intense efforts to win the support or joining of independent legislators to form the government.\n\nThe PILDAT Assessment of Quality of General Election 2018 is a continuation of earlier similar assessments that have been carried out by the think tank after General Elections of 2002, 2008 and 2013. Similar assessments in the past assigned the overall score of 37.30% to the quality of General Election 2002 and 40% to the quality of GE 2008. The scores improved for the quality of General Election 2013 at 56.76% but have dropped again to 51.79% for the quality of General Election 2018. This drop in the quality is mainly due to Poor Quality of Pre-poll phase which is largely attributable to the factors lying outside the direct remit of the ECP, the institute found.","56":"Pakistan is heading for one of its \u201cdirtiest elections in many years\u201d, observers and political campaigners have warned, with candidates alleging widespread interference by the country\u2019s powerful army, a report published in Financial Times said.\n\nThe report mentions Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) members who claimed to have been \u201ctargeted by members of the intelligence services\u201d.\n\nTalking to the FT, former premier Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said, \u201cThere has been coercion on members of our party to switch sides, with many of them being threatened with corruption cases.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is shaping up to be the worst election since 2002 \u2014 people have begun treating it as a joke,\u201d Abbasi added.\n\nThe report sheds light on the hostility between the PML-N and the army, calling it all-time high after Nawaz Sharif was ousted as prime minister and party leader on corruption charges that his allies say were orchestrated by the military.\n\nRISING CIV-MIL TENSIONS:\n\nPML-N government remained in power until parliament was dissolved in May in preparation for the election under a caretaker government. Last week Mr Sharif was jailed for 10 years in a judgment that could see him unable to campaign during the election.\n\nMeanwhile, many members of his party said they had been called by people they believed to be working for the army and urged to switch allegiances.\n\nSome said their movements had been monitored and occasionally obstructed, while others alleged they had been hounded through the courts. Abbasi\u2019s own nomination papers were challenged in the Supreme Court, which eventually ruled in his favour.\n\nHARASSMENT OF CANDIDATES:\n\nThe army has denied political interference, with Major General Asif Ghafoor, its spokesman, saying it would play its role in a \u201cnon-political and impartial manner\u201d.\n\nThe PML-N is engaged in a two-way fight with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, the anti-corruption party led by Imran Khan, Pakistan\u2019s former cricket captain. Mr Khan has denied allegations that he was being backed by the country\u2019s powerful generals, and has condemned any harassment of election candidates.\n\nPresuming the vote goes ahead as planned, it will be only the second time Pakistan has made a transition from one civilian government to another. But the security of the election process has been thrown into doubt by a string of attacks on election rallies, including one in Mastung that killed 149 people.\n\nSome accuse the army of not doing enough to provide security for political candidates, while others accuse it of outright harassment.\n\nConcerns about the treatment of the PTI\u2019s main opponents, including the Pakistan People\u2019s Party and the Awami National Party, have prompted Pakistan\u2019s human rights commission to issue a damning report into the election process.\n\nThe commission said this week it was \u201cgravely concerned over what it sees as blatant, aggressive and unabashed attempts to manipulate the outcome of the upcoming elections\u201d.\n\nIt said it was also concerned by the army\u2019s plan to put 370,000 troops on the streets on polling day, compared with just 70,000 at the previous general election in 2013.\n\nMEDIA CENSORSHIP:\n\nJournalists said they were also coming under increased pressure to toe the army\u2019s line, with those who failed to comply facing problems with distributing their news. In March, cable television services in certain areas of the country began blocking the transmission of the television station Geo, while the English-language Dawn newspaper said its sales networks had been disrupted.\n\nMeanwhile, election observers from international organisations said their visas and government accreditations had been delayed for weeks, giving them only a few days on the ground before polling day next Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe have never had a situation like this in any of our 150-plus missions,\u201d said Dmitra Ioannou, the deputy chief observer for the EU observation mission. \u201cUsually our long-term observers would spend five to six weeks on the ground. This time, because of all the delays with our paperwork, they will get just one to two weeks, if that.\u201d","57":"LAHORE: Although Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) is ahead of all other political parties in terms of the overall support among the masses across the country, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) is quickly gaining ground with increasing prominence, surveys conducted by Gallup Pakistan, Pulse Consultant and IPOR concluded.\n\nPUNJAB:\n\nAs far as provincial following is concerned, the polls revealed that PML-N remains the preferred party among voters in the largest province. However, PTI has gained moment and narrowed the gap with the passage of time.\n\nIPOR poll, which focused only Punjab, found 51 per cent of respondents voting for the PML-N while 30 per cent confirming their vote for the PTI. 5 per cent of the respondents selected the PPP for 2018 polls.\n\nKHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA:\n\nPTI remains the dominant party for voters in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), while PPP is ahead in Sindh. Both Gallup and Pulse converged that PTI could sweep the provincial seats in KP with 57 per cent support. PML-N and JUI-F were found to have lesser supporters than PTI.\n\nBALOCHISTAN:\n\nIn Balochistan, there is a mixed support of three parties \u2013 PPP, MMA\/JUI-F\/PTI. PPP is the preferred party for voters in Balochistan in the Pulse survey. MMA and JUI-F are ahead of other parties, according to Gallup.\n\nSINDH:\n\nThe PPP remained the most preferred party in Sindh in both Gallup and Pulse polls. They found no change in voter preference for the party from 2017 as 44 per cent of the voters still expressed that they would vote for the party. The PTI\u2019s popularity among voters changed very little while 4 per cent said they would be voting for the PML-N in the province.

He filed his nomination papers to contest the upcoming general elections for PS-13 (Dokri-Badeh) against the decades-old feudal and most powerful politicians despite lacking the wealth to run the luxurious election campaign.\n\nMirani has vast experience in the education sector with his earlier jobs as principal of Army Public School in Dadu and as vice principal at Army Public School in Pano Aqil, district Ghotki.\n\nHaving no grudge against any political party (except those corrupt individuals), Mirani only wishes that well-educated and honest candidates from any political party should be voted to power who could serve the poor people of the province, ensure quality education, provide healthcare facilities, local government system can fight against Patwari culture and etc.\n\nUsually, the constituency for provincial assembly PS-13 Dokri-Badeh remained within the lap of Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP) since past couple of years and party\u2019s nominated Aziz Jatoi used to get elected from the said constituency.\n\nHowever, this time, PPP has sidelined Mr Jatoi and awarded party ticket to Hizbullah Bughio compelling Aziz Jatoi to part ways and announced that he would contest upcoming elections as an independent candidate. While, the opposition alliance \u2013 Grand Democratic Alliance \u2013 has awarded party ticket to Aadil Altaf Unnar, and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf to Shafqat Unnar on the same constituency.\n\nWhile campaigning even on bicycle and donkey-cart, Liaquat Ali Mirani has mobilized students, writers, educated youth and the oppressed masses against the feudal lords since acceptance of his nomination papers for the constituency.\n\n\u201cThe consistent poor governance, massive corruption worth billions of rupees, vanishing of province\u2019s resources etc will ultimately result in providing a chance to middle class leaders to get elected against the corrupt mafias who have ruled the province since past ten years\u201d, Mirani told Pakistan Today by phone from his Dokri, town of district Larkana.\n\n\u201cI have no funds to run lavish type of election campaigns like they (feudal) run.

Using Twitter bots, political parties aim to manufacture consent and develop favourable opinion to gain maximum votes.\n\nWhen (allegedly) three girls speak to you at the same time \ud83d\ude06 pic.twitter.com\/0JTmzdrbCR \u2014 Mansoor Ali Khan (@_Mansoor_Ali) March 31, 2018\n\nA Twitter user expressed rage over the issue and demanded the social media giant to take notice of the matter. \u201cIt\u2019s time @Twitter make a serious effort to crack down on PML-N fake bots operating online. Most of them use pictures of fake girls too.\u201d\n\nHowever, the issue is not limited to any single political front. Parties from both left and right-wings are suspected of relying on bots to propagate their messages. A number of Twitter trends seen daily are either sponsored or built using the automated help.\n\nQuoting an anonymous social media executive of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), The Diplomat reported that almost \u201ceveryone is running fake Facebook accounts and Twitter bots\u201d in Pakistan to keep \u201cpace with what others are doing\u201d.\n\nAlthough Twitter announced in February that it would be cracking down on bots after changes to the API to massively reduce the impact of services that allow links and content to be shared across multiple accounts, the move also reduced some real user\u2019s follower counts. The platform largely believes in making its tools apolitical.\n\n\u201cTwitter\u2019s tools are apolitical, and we enforce our rules without political bias\u2026we also take action on any accounts we find that violate our terms of service, including asking account owners to confirm a phone number so we can confirm a human is behind it,\u201d it said.\n\nGOVT TO BLAME?\n\nSocial media activists belonging to the PTI often accuse the rivals, especially the government, of unleashing the bots to counter unfavourable opinions. One Twitter user wrote, \u201cPML-N always had a media cell and they were (still are) using for false propaganda against opposition by employing IT ppl creating BOTS on Twitter, fake followers etc. Now, they\u2019re openly doing it.\u201d\n\nThe opposition parties\u2019 wings go on to accuse the PML-N of being involved in malpractices through the IT ministry. The ruling party could be purchasing user\u2019s data to manipulate the 2018 elections due to its power over the IT ministry, a member of the rival social media wing claimed. Similarly, experts criticise the government over its failure to enact data protection laws.\n\nOn the other hand, the PTI is too accused of starting hashtag trends whenever faced with severe criticism. A Twitter user complained, \u201cThe reply to any fact-based criticism against PTI is to get PTI trolls\/cyber troll\/bots to \u2018grab their keyboards\u2019 and start a hashtag trend.\u201d\n\nAccording to Pew Research data, an estimated two-thirds of tweeted links to popular websites are posted by automated accounts, not human beings. The study adds that among popular news and current event websites, 66% of tweeted links are made by suspected bots.\n\nNot very far away from Pakistan, The Time recently reported that thousands of bots appeared in Malaysia just after the midweek election date was announced.\n\nTWITTER ACCOUNTS AT RISK:\n\nApart from bots, security concerns too haunt every single Twitter user in Pakistan. The platform itself advised the millions of users to change passwords after bug exposed them in plain text.\n\nThe company recommended that users should change their passwords out of an \u201cabundance of caution,\u201d both on the site itself and anywhere else they may have used that password, including the third-party apps like Twitterrific and TweetDeck.\n\n\u201cWe recently found a bug that stored passwords unmasked in an internal log.

As a precaution, consider changing your password on all services where you\u2019ve used this password,\u201d it said in the latest blog.","75":"RAHIM YAR KHAN: Member National Assembly (MNA) and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) central leader Hamza Shehbaz on Thursday said the Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) would be \u201cclean bowled\u201d in the upcoming general elections as the PTI chief didn\u2019t know that \u201chaving a waistcoat wasn\u2019t enough to become the prime minister\u201d.\n\nAddressing a workers\u2019 convention of the PML-N in Rahim Yar Khan, Hamza said that hard work like that of Nawaz Sharif besides public service was the most important thing needed to lead the masses.\n\nHe said that Imran Khan would not be able to mislead the people with his baseless allegations anymore and if votes in the Senate polls were sold in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), it was Imran himself who was responsible.\n\nThe PML-N leader also said that after criticising Lahore\u2019s metro bus for five years, the KP government was now working on the same project in the province.
